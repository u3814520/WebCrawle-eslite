9780135181966,"Object-oriented programming (OOP) is the foundation of modern programming languages, including C++, Java, C#, Visual Basic .NET, Ruby, Objective-C, and Swift. Objects also form the basis for many web technologies such as JavaScript, Python, and PHP.  It is of vital importance to learn the fundamental concepts of object orientation before starting to use object-oriented development environments. OOP promotes good design practices, code portability, and reuse-but it requires a shift in thinking to be fully understood. Programmers new to OOP should resist the temptation to jump directly into a particular programming language or a modeling language, and instead first take the time to learn what author Matt Weisfeld calls ""the object-oriented thought process.""  Written by a developer for developers who want to improve their understanding of object-oriented technologies, The Object-Oriented Thought Process provides a solutions-oriented approach to object-oriented programming. Readers will learn to understand the proper uses of inheritance and composition, the difference between aggregation and association, and the important distinction between interfaces and implementations.  While programming technologies have been changing and evolving over the years, object-oriented concepts remain a constant-no matter what the platform. This revised edition focuses on the OOP technologies that have survived the past 20 years and remain at its core, with new and expanded coverage of design patterns, avoiding dependencies, and the SOLID principles to help make software designs understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

9780241269152,"What is reality, really?Are humans more special or important than the non-human objects we perceive?How does this change the way we understand the world?We humans tend to believe that things are only real in as much as we perceive them, an idea reinforced by modern philosophy, which privileges us as special, radically different in kind from all other objects. But as Graham Harman, one of the theory's leading exponents, shows, Object-Oriented Ontology rejects the idea of human specialness: the world, he states, is clearly not the world as manifest to humans. At the heart of this philosophy is the idea that objects - whether real, fictional, natural, artificial, human or non-human - are mutually autonomous. In this brilliant new introduction, Graham Harman lays out the history, ideas and impact of Object-Oriented Ontology, taking in everything from art and literature, politics and natural science along the way. Graham Harman is Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at SCI-Arc, Los Angeles. A key figure in the contemporary speculative realism movement in philosophy and for his development of the field of object-oriented ontology, he was named by Art Review magazine as one of the 100 most influential figures in international art."

9781593275402,"If you've used a more traditional object-oriented language, such as C++ or Java, JavaScript probably doesn't seem object-oriented at all. It has no concept of classes, and you don't even need to define any objects in order to write code. But don't be fooled--JavaScript is an incredibly powerful and expressive object-oriented language that puts many design decisions right into your hands. In The Principles of Object-Oriented JavaScript, Nicholas C. Zakas thoroughly explores JavaScript's object-oriented nature, revealing the language's unique implementation of inheritance and other key characteristics. You'll learn: -The difference between primitive and reference values-What makes JavaScript functions so unique-The various ways to create objects-How to define your own constructors-How to work with and understand prototypes-Inheritance patterns for types and objects The Principles of Object-Oriented JavaScript will leave even experienced developers with a deeper understanding of JavaScript.

This one's a keeper."" --Robert C. Martin  ""If you want to be an expert in the state of the art in TDD, you need to understand the ideas in this book.""--Michael Feathers  Test-Driven Development (TDD) is now an established technique for delivering better software faster. TDD is based on a simple idea: Write tests for your code before you write the code itself. However, this simple idea takes skill and judgment to do well. Now there's a practical guide to TDD that takes you beyond the basic concepts. Drawing on a decade of experience building real-world systems, two TDD pioneers show how to let tests guide your development and ""grow"" software that is coherent, reliable, and maintainable.   Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce describe the processes they use, the design principles they strive to achieve, and some of the tools that help them get the job done. Through an extended worked example, you'll learn how TDD works at multiple levels, using tests to drive the features and the object-oriented structure of the code, and using Mock Objects to discover and then describe relationships between objects. Along the way, the book systematically addresses challenges that development teams encounter with TDD--from integrating TDD into your processes to testing your most difficult features. Coverage includes   - Implementing TDD effectively: getting started, and maintaining your momentum  throughout the project - Creating cleaner, more expressive, more sustainable code - Using tests to stay relentlessly focused on sustaining quality  - Understanding how TDD, Mock Objects, and Object-Oriented Design come together  in the context of a real software development project - Using Mock Objects to guide object-oriented designs - Succeeding where TDD is difficult: managing complex test data, and testing persistence and concurrency "

Instead of using toy tools to create modeling and coding examples, the author teaches IBM Rational Rhapsody as a modeling tool and Microsoft Visual C# as a programming tool. C# is the purest object-oriented programming language and the best tool for developing graphical user interfaces, while Rhapsody is a visual development environment that real software developers use to create real-time or embedded systems.This book serves as a text for a capstone course on Systems Analysis and Design in Information Systems programs. It conceptualizes business objects and functions, develops business models and software architectures, and enriches the models and the architectures by storyboarding use cases along with user interface designs."

The only prerequisites for this book are familiarity with basic algorithms and data structures (lists, maps, recursion, etc.), a rudimentary knowledge of computer architecture and assembly language, and some experience with the Java programming language.A complete study of compilers could easily fill several graduate-level courses, and therefore some simplifications and compromises are necessary for a one-semester course that is accessible to undergraduate students. Following are some of the decisions made in order to accommodate the goals of this book.The book has a narrow focus as a project-oriented course on compilers. Compiler theory is kept to a minimum, but the project orientation retains the ""fun"" part of studying compilers.The source language being compiled is relatively simple, but it is powerful enough to be interesting and challenging. It has basic data types, arrays, procedures, functions, and parameters, but it relegates many other interesting language features to the project exercises.The target language is assembly language for a virtual machine with a stack-based architecture, similar to but much simpler than the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This approach greatly simplifies code generation. Both an assembler and an emulator for the virtual machine are provided on the course web site.No special compiler-related tools are required or used within the book. Students require access only to a Java compiler and a text editor, but most students will want to use Java with an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).One very important component of a compiler is the parser, which verifies that a source program conforms to the language syntax and produces an intermediate representation of the program that is suitable for additional analysis and code generation. There are several different approaches to parsing, but in keeping with the focus on a one-semester course, this book emphasizes only one approach, recursive descent parsing with one symbol lookahead."

Previously undocumented, these 23 patterns allow designers to create more flexible, elegant, and ultimately reusable designs without having to rediscover the design solutions themselves.  The authors begin by describing what patterns are and how they can help you design object-oriented software. They then go on to systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. With Design Patterns as your guide, you will learn how these important patterns fit into the software development process, and how you can leverage them to solve your own design problems most efficiently.  Each pattern describes the circumstances in which it is applicable, when it can be applied in view of other design constraints, and the consequences and trade-offs of using the pattern within a larger design. All patterns are compiled from real systems and are based on real-world examples. Each pattern also includes code that demonstrates how it may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages like C++ or Smalltalk."

9781509512683,"In this book, the founder of object-oriented ontology develops his view that aesthetics is the central discipline of philosophy. Whereas science must attempt to grasp an object in terms of its observable qualities, philosophy and art cannot proceed in this way because they don't have direct access to their objects. Hence philosophy shares the same fate as art in being compelled to communicate indirectly, allusively, or elliptically, rather than in the clear propositional terms that are often taken – wrongly – to be the sole stuff of genuine philosophy.Conceiving of philosophy and art in this way allows us to reread key debates in aesthetic theory and to view art history in a different way. The formalist criticism of Greenberg and Fried is rejected for its refusal to embrace the innate theatricality and deep multiplicity of every artwork. This has consequences for art criticism, making pictorial content more important than formalism thinks but less entwined with the social sphere than anti-formalism holds. It has consequences for art history too, as the surrealists, David, and Poussin, among others, gain in importance. The close link between aesthetics and ontology also invites a new periodization of modern philosophy as a whole, and the habitual turn away from Kant’s thing-in-itself towards an increase in philosophical ""immanence"" is shown to be a false dawn.This major work will be of great interest to students and scholars of philosophy, aesthetics, art history and cultural theory."

9789864341894,學習設計模式的人，一定聽過《Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software》這本書，俗稱GoF的《設計模式》或GoF的23個設計模式。早期就開始學習設計模式的前輩也大多讀過那本書。GoF的設計模式只有23個嗎？其實不只23個，在該書出版之時，有接近半打的模式未能被放入該書當中，原因有很多，例如在當年尚未取得兩個以上的大型專案實例來驗證可行性、尚未取得四人的共識、與其他模式之間的分界尚不明朗等等，都可能會導致一些模式未被納入。該書的遺珠之憾是那些模式呢？在本書中，作者（GoF的四位成員之一）補充了兩個模式，其中的GENERATION GAP模式已經獲得共識，只是在當年的實例不夠多，但現在看來，實在是稀鬆平常，到處都可以看到開發環境或框架採用了這個模式。至於另一個TYPED MESSAGE模式，在規劃初期是叫做MULTICAST模式，這個模式初期只取得其中三人的同意。藉著這個尚未取得共識的模式，作者揭露了當初在撰寫《Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software》時，四位作者之間對於模式的討論方式，讓讀者得以一窺大師們的討論、思想、以及對軟體設計的習慣。並且在說服反對者的最後關頭，還加入了另一位大師《Clean Code》作者Robert C. Martin（Bob大叔）的支援。如果您仔細閱讀本書第四章及第五章，會發現原來要成為一個新模式真是不簡單啊！那些面世的模式全都是大師們的心血結晶，無價的經驗寶藏。早期，有些人會批評《Design Patterns》不適合作為學習設計模式的第一本書，或許是因為有些人看的、寫的專案不夠多，所以無法體會其中的奧妙。後來，由於設計模式被大多數高級軟體工程師接受了，因此寫了非常多的相關書籍來介紹設計模式，漸漸地，設計模式不再那麼令人敬畏，也成為了軟體設計的顯學。而這類比較容易理解的書籍，通常都是採用最適合初階讀者的寫法，也就是舉出實例來說明模式。而且舉的例子越是程式設計師理解的例子，就越能使程式設計師學會設計模式並加以活用。有些書籍，只針對每個模式舉出一個例子，但無法找出一些好例子，可同時應用多個模式來完成同一個例子中不同的功能要求，這樣的寫作法，常常誤導了讀者，違背了設計模式的目的。換言之，一招半式是要如何走江湖呢？本書有別於那些書籍，在本書第二章中，作者以程式設計師最能理解的檔案系統為例，實際示範如何應用六個模式來解決檔案系統不同的功能需求，這六個模式之間的相互合作方式，讓人眼睛為之一亮。讚嘆道︰「原來設計模式是這樣用的啊！」許多讀者都在期待《設計模式》的第二版，而第二版會是什麼樣子呢？這很難說（也可能不會有第二版了），但至少可以肯定的是，本書作者對於《設計模式》第二版所能做出的貢獻，都已經寫在這本書當中了。

程式碼的可讀性、可擴展性、可測試性是攸關程式碼品質的重要參考指標。本書教您如何寫好程式，分析劣質程式碼所帶來的不愉快經驗，主張採用接近自然語言的方式來書寫程式碼，並針對提升設計能力、英語能力，熟悉開發環境、瞭解程式語言等諸多方面提出相應的具體改善策略。

為什麼寫不出好的程式碼?
．對理論知識瞭解不夠會造成不佳的程式設計習慣，進而帶來潛在的Bug風險。
．受限於舊版本與程式語言的不熟悉，而無法掌握最新的產品特性來書寫更為精煉的程式碼。
．不瞭解設計方法而耗費大量時間，把簡單問題複雜化，重複實作已有完整解決方案的程式碼。 
．設計方法不佳造成程式碼的問題，如重複與類似、長方法、複雜分支、類別膨脹。
．對於開發環境不夠熟悉，導致很多方便、快捷的功能沒有獲得良好的利用，如重構技術、外掛程式。
．能掌握的英語單詞量不足、語法不明確、詞性不熟悉等原因，造成程式碼在書寫上與閱讀上的苦惱。
．套用相似案例的快速學習法，使得程式碼未能保持最佳風格，甚至會因思慮不周而讓可讀性變差。
．為了快速完成功能而採用臨時的解決方案，往往留下了技術債務，無法因應系統的變動與修改Bug。
．在任務分配的管理模式下，程式師只是機械式地堆砌程式碼，無法在設計的環節上作全面性的思考。
