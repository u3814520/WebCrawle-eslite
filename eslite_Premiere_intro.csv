「艾薇塔」東尼獎最佳音樂劇女主角佩蒂露朋領銜主唱不朽情歌“With One Look”、“As If We Never Said Goodbye”
全新雙CD數位錄音版：呈現倫敦首演頂尖原始卡司，精裝加贈原文歌詞本

安德烈洛依韋伯根據奧斯卡名導比利懷德執導，威廉荷頓與葛洛莉亞史璜森領銜主演1951年奧斯卡11項提名電影「日落大道」所改編而成的同名音樂劇，劇情描述默片女星諾瑪戴斯蒙一直期盼重返電影大銀幕，但是，這個夢想卻因為有聲電影時代到來而遭片廠否決，某天，她與一位努力想要在好萊塢闖出一片天的年輕編劇家喬吉利斯相遇，諾瑪把喬吉利斯視為她重返影壇的大好機會，兩人之間的合作關係最後竟演變成一個難以預料的悲劇。

訴說著逝去的榮景與無法實現的野心的華麗音樂劇【日落大道】在1993年的7月12號、12月9號分別於英、美首演後，總計連演超過2500場，美國的首演門票銷售在當年以3750萬美金的門票收入刷新了百老匯史上最高預售票門票營收紀錄，美國的製作版本同時在1995年東尼獎中勇奪最佳音樂劇等7座大獎。此齣戲碼同時也陸續在加拿大、德國與澳洲等地公演。

韋伯在1976年進行「艾薇塔」音樂劇創作期間就萌生音樂劇改編的想法，在經過12年腦力激盪，還有與擁有電影版權的派拉蒙電影公司交涉，韋伯終於在「Aspects Of Love」這齣戲於1989年倫敦首演後取得了【日落大道】的音樂劇改編權，韋伯邀請曾與他合作過「Aspects Of Love」音樂劇腳本與歌曲創作的Don Black與以電影「危險關係」劇本聞名的英國劇作家Christopher Hampton攜手創作，三人同時以此劇拿下東尼獎最佳音樂劇腳本與歌曲創作大獎。

此張世界首演版錄音大碟是1993年7月26號~8月10號期間倫敦公演場次的錄音，主要卡司包括曾在1980年以「艾薇塔」榮獲東尼獎最佳音樂劇女主角的名伶Patti LuPone/佩蒂露朋，多次獲得東尼獎提名的劇場名星Kevin Anderson/凱文安德森，參與過「艾薇塔」演出的Daniel Benzali以及參與過「悲慘世界」演出的紐西蘭演員Meredith Braun，此齣戲碼中的“With One Look”、“As If We Never Said Goodbye”都是音樂劇史上觸動人心的精緻唱作。

9781847497956,"Between 1892 and 1895, Oscar Wilde's drawing-room comedies Lady Windermere's Fan, A Woman of No Importance, An Ideal Husband and The Importance of Being Earnest made his name as a playwright who fearlessly mocked the hypocrisy and snobbery of Victorian society and took gleeful delight in appearing to trivialize its most sacred institutions. With its premiere on Valentine's Day 1895, The Importance of Being Earnest – a hilarious comedy of mistaken identities and coruscating language – was a phenomenal success, but its run was cut short prematurely by Wilde's court case and subsequent incarceration, and the play was not published until 1899, after Wilde had been released from prison.Also including the powerful Salome, originally written in French and banned by the British censor, this collection displays Wilde at his provocative and witty best, and demonstrates why he was a playwright who delighted audiences and infuriated critics in equal measure."
0659696494213,"Austin Boogie Crew had to do something special for our first vinyl release of 2019, and with that we present H1NDS1GHT, a killer double 7"" modern funk EP by the one and only XL Middleton! Hailing from Pasadena, California, XL has established himself as one of the premiere musicians, label owners (MoFunk Records), and tastemakers in the game. Using outstanding and mostly unreleased material from his archives as the foundation for this project (hence the name H1NDS1GHT), XL reimagined these songs and penned fresh lyrics specifically for the release. We divided the EP into two 45s, each with it's own distinct vibe, and with the help of illustrator Austin Cashell and designer Rene Cardenas, created a unique album jacket that forms one image when the two records are held side by side. Viewed as a whole, this EP is an exceptional ride that will carry you from spring into summer! Vol. 2 A: ""Gamin'"" (120 BPM) - Broken beat inspired drums and soaring chords lay the groundwork for this exceptional jam about approaching a woman with respect and care. With a sick solo and some vocoder peppered into the mix, this is a winner in more ways than one. B: ""Enjoyable Sunburn"" (116 BPM) - XL crafts a playful yet smooth instrumental that would sound at home in an Outrun video game or on the Beverly Hills Cop soundtrack. But it isn't just the nostalgia factor that will keep you coming back to this one, it's the compositional finesse, amazing synth sounds, and heart."

,"Limited 180gm vinyl LP pressing. A Charlie Brown Christmas is a 1965 studio album by American composer/conductor Vince Guaraldi. The album was released in December 1965 in the United States by Fantasy Records. It is the soundtrack to the CBS Christmas television special of the same name. Guaraldi was contacted by television producer Lee Mendelson several years prior to compose music for a documentary on the comic strip Peanuts and it's creator, Charles M. Schulz. A Charlie Brown Christmas features several originals (""Christmas Time Is Here"", ""Linus and Lucy"") as well as covers of well-known Christmas songs (""The Christmas Song"", ""O Tannenbaum""). The score for the special was largely cut at recording sessions at Glendale, California's Whitney Studio. Much of this material was re-recorded by Guaraldi at three sessions later in the year at Fantasy Recording Studios in San Francisco, alongside a choir of children culled from St. Paul's Episcopal Church in nearby San Rafael. Released a week prior to the broadcast premiere of the special, A Charlie Brown Christmas sold well, and became increasingly famous in the ensuing decades. It is among the most popular Christmas albums in the United States, where it has been certified Quadruple Platinum, having shipped at least four million copies. tracksA1 O TannenbaumA2 What Child Is ThisA3 My Little DrumA4 Linus and LucyA5 Christmas Time Is Here [Instrumental]B1 Christmas Time Is Here [Vocal]B2 SkatingB3 Hark, the Herald Angels SingB4 Christmas Is ComingB5 Fur EliseB6 The Christmas Song"
9780984509799,"A solar PV energy scientist at America’s premiere National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the pioneering CEO of Motech Solar, Dr. Simon Tsuo led an exciting life while discovering the innovative crystalline silicon technology that is responsible for much of the world’s current solar energy resources. This book tells the tales of Tsuo’s rediscovery of his roots in a transforming Taiwan, entrepreneurialism, business strategies, and the rise of the solar sector and the green economy. Dr. Simon Tsuo was born in China in 1948 just one year before the conclusion of its civil war, in which his father led more than 4,000 men on the nationalist (KMT) side. After the KMT’s defeat in the Chinese Civil War and his family’s fleeing on a seized tanker boat, Dr. Tsuo grew up under its exiled “one party state” in Taiwan. There, he learned to navigate the Taiwan of his youth, and like many of the post-war generation, he excelled academically in order to qualify for further opportunities in America.After a cultural journey of American exploration, Dr. Tsuo attained a PhD in applied physics which led him to a successful career at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, America’s only federal government renewable research institute. There, he delved into a 20 year-long research path during solar energy’s “warring technologies period,” through which he became convinced that crystalline silicon was to become the leading technology. With this insight, Dr. Tsuo eventually returned to Taiwan to establish Motech Solar as one of the world’s first crystalline silicon-only solar cell firms. With a visionary strategy, Dr. Tsuo overcame many challenges to lead Motech Solar to become a global sector leader, which spawned Taiwan’s solar sector."

3149020221426,"The 1782 premiere in Vienna of 'Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail' was an unprecedented success. This dazzling triumph was enhanced by a libretto celebrating and counter to contemporary prejudices concerning the Ottoman Empire. Mozart gave an important place to the spoken dialogue, often severely cut, but fully restored and brought to life here by RenE Jacobs in the culmination of his Mozart opera recordings for harmonia mundi.""Mari Eriksmoen was an charming and malicious Blonde with a light and elegant soprano well-suited to the fiery English maid. As Konstanze, Robin Johannssen's soprano boasted a middle range with silvery tones. The male side of the cast was just perfect. As Pedrillo, Julian PrEgardien allied both appealing singing and jubilatory acting. Maximilian Schmitt's Belmonte impressed by his powerful and manly lyric sound and with aptly executed fioriturain ""Ich baue ganz auf deine Starke""... The strongest performance however came from Dimitry Ivaschenko. The Russian bass, combining splendid deep tone with extreme flexibility, managed to convey the comical side of his character, without reducing it to the buffoonery that often mars other interpretations.Totally at one with the theatrical approach to the performance, the Akademie fur Alte Musik Berlin followed the maestro's contrasted tempi and played superbly…this performance at the Concertgebouw took place a few days after Mr. Jacobs recorded the work in the studio with the same team of soloists and orchestra. Without the visual support, that recording will be a very different experience but I'd certainly be keen to see if it matches up to my memories."" Nicolas Nguyen, 21 September 2014, bachtrack.com"

3149020221228,"At the height of the famous Querelle des Bouffons (1754), the elderly Rameau yielded to insistent requests from the Académie Royale de Musique for a major revision of Castor and Pollux, 17 years after the lukewarm reception of its premiere.He deleted the Prologue and made substantial modifications to the dramatic structure, with a completely new first act! But the original has continued to overshadow the revision, unjustly so when one considers the modernity of its orchestration. The inspired direction of Raphaël Pichon shows the extent to which this music heralds the Classical orchestra."
0099925399429,"This is not the first case of a premiere performance of a work by Bohuslav Martinu (1890-1959) decades after his death. On 11 December 2008 the sold-out Rudolfinum in Prague heard for the first time a work which ranks among Martinu's most significant and which the composer himself highly esteemed. Martinu originally composed the opera Juliette in Czech. However, so as to ensure appropriate publicity for the work, he wanted - already armed with a French libretto - to place extracts from the most relevant scenes on French radio. Yet Three Fragments from the Opera Juliette (The Key to Dreams) was not broadcast on the radio and had to wait some 70 years for its first performance. This was entrusted to the safe hands of that most competent of conductors Sir Charles Mackerras, who has devoted a great part of his life to discovering Czech music and promoting it on world stages. Thanks to Martinu's dreamily beautiful music and the remarkable engagement of all the interpreters, the conductor's December leave-taking of the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra was transformed into a joint triumph. After experiencing Magdalena Kozena in the role of Juliette, it is hard to imagine another star singer in her place. The Australian tenor Steve Davislim, who performed in the role of Michel, was a splendid partner to Magdalena Kozenain the lyrical and dramatic position. On this CD, Three Fragments is supplemented by the orchestral suite from the same opera, which sensitively treats the music of all three Acts and corresponds with the ""dreamy logic"" of the original."
0095115080726,"The internationally acclaimed harpsichordist and early classical music specialist Julian Perkins here presents the premiere recording of six Suites for harpsichord by Handel's assistant, John Christopher Smith. The new release on Chaconne also features an arrangement by Handel of the overture to his opera Riccardo Primo. Music assistants often have a poor press. Franz Süssmayr is known only for his controversial completion of Mozart's Requiem, while Robert Craft is known largely for his role as Stravinsky's assistant. As Handel's amanuensis, John Christopher Smith has suffered a similar fate. Moreover, confusion has prevailed as to his identity. His father shared the same Christian names and was Handel's original amanuensis. Thus the omens for Smith's musical legacy were poor from the start. This project seeks to reappraise Smith the composer, whose prolific music bubbles over with brilliance, wit, and charm not to mention an irresistible penchant for trills! As a man of the theatre, Smith cultivated a style that evinces a comic interplay between the baroque and rococo; in his pieces, athletic hand crossings, unpredictable figurations, sudden shifts from major to minor keys, and sequences built over repeated left-hand chords vie with one another to create music that is both technically demanding and theatrical."
0095115514825,"The Grammy-Award-winning conductor Charles Bruffy brings together his two professional choirs, the Kansas City Chorale and Phoenix Chorale, for this recording of Serge Rachmaninoff's All-night Vigil. The scheduled release date marks the 100th anniversary of the world premiere of the work, which was given by the Moscow Synodal Choir on 10 March 1915. The recording follows live performances of the work by the combined ensembles in April and May 2014, respectively in Phoenix and Kansas City. The Phoenix Chorale and Kansas City Chorale are regarded as among the finest professional choral ensembles in the world. Their recordings have earned a combined total of ten Grammy-Award-nominations and four wins. Building on the success of previous collaborations, the performances marked the seventh time that the two choirs have performed together. Of their 2009 performance at Alice Tully Hall in New York, Vivien Schweitzer of The New York Times wrote that the choirs 'performed with a buoyant pulse and energetic finesse', and praised 'the choirs' refined sound and elegant phrasing'. Serge Rachmaninoff's All-night Vigil stands as the crowning achievement of the 'Golden Age' of Russian Orthodox sacred choral music. The texts are drawn from the Russian Orthodox liturgy and the music goes beyond the strict requirements of the liturgical ritual, making it better suited for concert presentations of sacred choral music than for worship services."

0099925416027,"WORLD PREMIERE RECORDINGS (12 - 16, 18 - 21, 23 - 26) An inherent, characteristic feature of the musical language of Zelenka and Tuma, the two most distinguished Czech Baroque composers, is perfectly mastered counterpoint, which alongside progressive trends in Baroque continued to live as a stile antico. Zelenka, Tuma, as well as their currently virtually unknown contemporary J. G. Orschler, studied in Vienna with the Imperial Kapellmeister Johann Joseph Fux (1660-1741). All three had strong Prague links and although they mainly gained recognition beyond the Czech lands, their music was performed and highly valued in Prague too. Zelenka's stile antico pieces represent a little-known yet interesting part of his oeuvre. Tuma's Stabat Mater is a masterpiece bearing witness to the transformation of the ""old craft"" into a new pre-Classicist style. The recording, made by the internationally renowned Collegium 1704 ensemble, includes several modern-time premieres providing us with a fascinating view of the little-known works by the three Czech Baroque masters.

0095115245224,"This ‘2for1’ reissue brings together the best performances by Neeme Järvi of the music by Bartók, taken from his extraordinarily prolific recording career with Chandos Records. The four works span Bartók career and include some of the greatest music he ever wrote.The Concerto for Orchestra has remained one of Bartók’s most popular orchestral works since its triumphant premiere in 1944. Its title signals that each section of instruments is treated in a soloistic and virtuoso way. According to Bartók himself, ‘the general mood of the work represents, apart from the jesting second movement, a gradual transition from the sternness of the first movement and the lugubrious death-song of the third, to the life-assertion of the last one’.The ballet The Miraculous Mandarin is heard here in its complete form. Set in a seedy urban underworld, it tells the tale of a prostitute, the three thugs that control her, and their mysterious encounter with the eponymous Mandarin. In portraying this scenario Bartók creates an astonishingly vivid score with some of the most colourful music he ever wrote.The Wooden Prince, an earlier ballet, could not on the surface be further from The Miraculous Mandarin. Lacking its daring modernism, it instead shows the influence of Debussy, Strauss, and Wagner. However, its outwardly sunny character obscures a strange and surreal undertone.The Hungarian Pictures are skilful and imaginative orchestrations made in 1931 of five earlier piano pieces. Each with its own distinct character, these pieces give the impression of being an authentic folksong arrangement, although this is true only of the last of the five."
0095115513828,"Jorge Grundman uses his unique compositional voice to create music which, above all, communicates with remarkable directness. The simplicity and strength of his artistic vision, intended to reach the widest audience possible, is clear in A Mortuis Resurgere, a work here receiving its premiere recording. Scored for soprano and string quartet, A Mortuis Resurgere sets passages from chapters XIX and XX of St John’s Gospel telling the story of the resurrection of Christ.Throughout its extended single movement the soprano soloist is required to use a wide range of expressive vocal techniques to communicate the meaning of the Latin text. Supporting the soprano voice is the string quartet, its slowly changing harmonies animated by a surface of rapid rhythmic figurations, all of which combine to produce shifting textures. The contemplative modal-based harmonies are typical of Grundman’s style and form a part of his artistic vision to bridge the gap between pop and classical music.Joining the Brodsky Quartet is the Spanish soprano Susana Cordón, for whom the challenging vocal part was written. Renowned for its diverse and pioneering collaborations, the Brodsky Quartet has been vital in the development of Grundman’s style, having worked closely with the composer on a number of his earlier works."

All are powerful experiences, reflecting the new physicality of Tüür’s compositions. Major performances of all three works have taken place in 2003, including the Violin Concerto at the London Proms (a major success). Tüür’s music continues to gain critical and popular acclaim, and this release is eagerly anticipated."

The canon had long fascinated the Estonian composer who finally decided to set it in its entirety in music written to mark the 750th anniversary of Cologne Cathedral. Pärt: ""It took over two years to compose the Kanon pokajanen, and its hold on me did not abate until I had finished the score...That may explain why this music means so much to me."" As writer Uwe Schweikert has noted, it is ""music full of austere, painful beauty."""
