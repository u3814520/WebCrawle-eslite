9781547416516," The introduction of online Bitcoin trading platforms has enabled Bitcoin to become mainstream in today's economy, making headline news with soaring valuations, and proving that the underlying Blockchain protocol can bring trust to a trustless world across a broad spectrum of industries and business processes. How Bitcoin and Blockchain Are Changing the World explains Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, the advantages and disadvantages of virtual currencies, using virtual currency for making transactions, why its value has dramatically fluctuated, and why other virtual currencies will take Bitcoin's place in the economic future. In addition, this book delves into the technical side of the Blockchain technology, including a discussion of the cryptographic technology protocol used for digital payments transmitted over the Internet.   Through illustrations and case studies, Marti Tirinnanzi discusses how and why different countries have adopted Bitcoin and other virtual currencies.

The book will help readers understand how Bitcoin and Blockchain are changing the approach to doing business in everything from financial services, healthcare, to the Internet of things (IoT). "

9789811221521,"This textbook focuses on distributed ledger technology (DLT) and its potential impact on society at large. It aims to offer a detailed and self-contained introduction to the founding principles behind DLT accessible to a well-educated but not necessarily mathematically oriented audience. DLT allows solving many complicated problems arising in economics, banking, and finance, industry, trade, and other fields. However, to reap the ultimate benefits, one has to overcome some of its inherent limitations and use it judiciously. Not surprisingly, amid increasing applications of DLT, misconceptions are formed over its use. The book thoroughly dispels these misconceptions via an impartial assessment of the arguments rooted in scientific reasoning.Blockchain and Distributed Ledgers: Mathematics, Technology, and Economics offers a detailed and self-contained introduction to DLT, blockchains, and cryptocurrencies and seeks to equip the reader with an ability to participate in the crypto economy meaningfully."

9781032093888,"Blockchain technology is poised to revolutionize more than just payment and crypto-currency. Many vertical industries will be reshaped by the new trusted data models enabled and inspired by the blockchain - healthcare is no exception. In fact, healthcare may hold the greatest opportunities for meaningful use of the technology. Early pioneers have explored some of the first use cases for medical payments, electronic health records, HIPAA/data privacy, drug counterfeiting, and credentialing of healthcare professionals. We have only begun to scratch the surface in how to automate the complexities of today's healthcare systems and design new systems which focus on trust, transparency and the alignment of incentives.Metcalf, Bass, Dhillon, and Hooper have curated a collection of examples based on the fundamentals of blockchain that build upon the early successes and examples that point to the future. After a brief introduction to bitcoin, blockchain and the protocols available, a getting-started guide is presented specific to health and healthcare. The authors discuss the complexities and possibilities of smart contracts and some of the early consortia that are exploring the possibilities. Examples and use cases are found throughout the book, with specific sections that cover the more sophisticated and far-reaching examples which have the potential to scale at the industry-level. In addition, a discussion of integrating blockchain technology into other advanced healthcare trends and IT systems - such as telemedicine, artificial intelligence, machine learning, the Internet of Things, value-based payments, patient engagement solutions, big data solutions, medical tourism, and precision medicine/genetic therapies among many others are presented. The final section provides a glimpse into the future using blockchain technology and examples of research projects that are still in labs across the globe. The appendices may prove particularly useful for additional details on how to get started, including resources and organizations specifically focusing on blockchain and distributed ledger solutions."

9783030709693,"This book explores blockchain technology's impact on banks, particularly how blockchain technology can create new opportunities for banks and poses new threats to their business. The digital revolution in the banking industry, whose customers are increasingly adapting to new technologies and new types of competitors and solutions arising in the space, has had a significant impact on the banking industry over the past few years, requiring banks to substantially rethink their business models and strategies in order to cope with these developments. The rise of blockchain's distributed ledger technology (DLT) has also played an important role since it has the potential to change the whole banking industry in faster and more disruptive ways than ever before.  Born as the technology underlying Bitcoin, which has been used to allow the recording of cryptocurrencies transactions, blockchain can facilitate the process of recording any transaction type and track the movement of any asset, finding application in many different areas. Specifically, it has been acknowledged as a disruptive force in the financial sector and a key source of future financial market innovation with the potential to reshape existing business models in the financial services industry.  Regarding the banking industry in particular, existing literature suggests that blockchain poses new challenges and generates opportunities as well as threats. This is pushing banks to rethink their operations, business models and strategies. However, literature in this regard is still in its infancy, and we do not yet have a clear understanding of blockchain technology's potential implications for banks. This book expands the literature on blockchain technology in banking by providing new insights into the developments, trends and challenges of blockchain in the banking industry. In particular, sheds more light on the implications of blockchain technology for banks by discussing the advantages and disadvantages related to this technology and exploring its potential impact on traditional banking business models."
9783030401443,"This book provides a comprehensive introduction to blockchain and distributed ledger technology. Intended as an applied guide for hands-on practitioners, the book includes detailed examples and in-depth explanations of how to build and run a blockchain from scratch. Through its conceptual background and hands-on exercises, this book allows students, teachers and crypto enthusiasts to launch their first blockchain while assuming prior knowledge of the underlying technology. How do I build a blockchain? How do I mint a cryptocurrency? How do I write a smart contract? How do I launch an initial coin offering (ICO)? These are some of questions this book answers. Starting by outlining the beginnings and development of early cryptocurrencies, it provides the conceptual foundations required to engineer secure software that interacts with both public and private ledgers. The topics covered include consensus algorithms, mining and decentralization, and many more. ""This is a one-of-a-kind book on Blockchain technology. The authors achieved the perfect balance between the breadth of topics and the depth of technical discussion. But the real gem is the set of carefully curated hands-on exercises that guide the reader through the process of building a Blockchain right from Chapter 1."" Volodymyr Babich, Professor of Operations and Information Management, McDonough School of Business, Georgetown University ""An excellent introduction of DLT technology for a non-technical audience. The book is replete with examples and exercises, which greatly facilitate the learning of the underlying processes of blockchain technology for all, from students to entrepreneurs."" Serguei Netessine, Dhirubhai Ambani Professor of Innovation and Entrepreneurship, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania""Whether you want to start from scratch or deepen your blockchain knowledge about the latest developments, this book is an essential reference. Through clear explanations and practical code examples, the authors take you on a progressive journey to discover the technology foundations and build your own blockchain. From an operations perspective, you can learn the principles behind the distributed ledger technology relevant for transitioning towards blockchain-enabled supply chains. Reading this book, you'll get inspired, be able to assess the applicability of blockchain to supply chain operations, and learn from best practices recognized in real-world examples."" Ralf W.

As the technology behind cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Facebook's Libra, open software platforms like Ethereum, and disruptive companies like Ripple, it's too important to ignore. Blockchain is the ingeniously simple, revolution-ary protocol that allows transactions to be simultaneously anonymous and secure by maintaining a tamperproof public ledger of value. Though it's best known as the technology that drives bitcoin and other digital cur-rencies, it also has the potential to go far beyond currency, to record virtually everything of value to humankind, from birth and death certifi-cates to insurance claims, land titles, and even votes. The blockchain can be used for the secure exchange of things like cash, property, contracts, and so forth without requiring a third-party intermediary like a bank or government.

Simply put, the blockchain technology is a form of a distributed ledger that is decentralized and public and can record transactions with a very high level of security. All the records in the blockchain are called blocks, and each of them is linked to the previous one with a hash pointer and is securely stored with cryptography.

Batten (CIMB-UUM Chair in Banking and Finance, Universiti Utara Malaysia & University of Sydney Business School, Sydney, Australia)  Shaen Corbet (Assistant Professor in Finance, Dublin City Business School, Ireland)  Brian M. Lucey (Professor of International Finance and Commodities, Trinity Business School, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland & University of Sydney Business School, Sydney, Australia)   Aims and Scope: Alternative investments constitute those assets that do not fall into the categories traditionally defined to be conventional. Such assets are traditionally used by large investors and hedge funds due to their relative complexity, regulatory requirements, non-standard risks, and often, significant minimum contract sizes and margin requirements. But as the products become more commonplace across international portfolios, and with a growing necessity for portfolio diversification from alternative sources due to the wide variety of black swan events occurring in recent times, it is vital to thoroughly examine the associated, and often unusual risks and events.  We have therefore established a handbook series that focuses on providing an outlet that can encourage debate for those with an interest in alternative investments across a wide-variety of disciplines, while also providing a thoroughly researched outlet that can be used for academic and educational purposes. Specifically, these handbooks will be useful for specialist audiences such as legal, accounting and financial practices, while also providing substantial benefits for upper master's level and research students in the fields of economics, law, accounting, taxation, investment and portfolio management.  The series aspires to contribute to a global perspective on the changing nature of alternative investment assets, seeking authors with innovative approaches to analyse and examine key issues within this developing asset class, which can be taken from a multi-disciplinary perspective. We welcome the submission of both monographs and edited collections that share these aims. We are particularly interested in new book proposals which might include: i) individual monographs; ii) edited volumes from multiple contributors across different organisations; and iii) technical publications covering specialist topics.

9781108712088,"In Blockchain Democracy, William Magnuson provides a breathtaking tour of the world of blockchain and bitcoin, from their origins in the online scribblings of a shadowy figure named Satoshi Nakamoto, to their furious rise and dramatic crash in the 2010s, to their ignominious connections to the dark web and online crime. Magnuson argues that blockchain's popularity stands as a testament both to the depth of distrust of government today, and also to the fervent and undying belief that technology and the world of cyberspace can provide an answer. He demonstrates how blockchain's failings provide broader lessons about what happens when technology runs up against the stubborn realities of law, markets, and human nature. This book should be read by anyone interested in understanding how technology is changing our democracy, and how democracy is changing our technology."
9780578474502,"The 2020s and 2030s will be witness to some of the most rapid, significant, and tumultuous changes in world history. The monetary and information systems that defined the late 20th and early 21st centuries will face their natural limits in the coming decade and quickly get disrupted by swift technological innovation. This time of crisis will define the remainder of the 21st century, much as 1914-1945 defined the 20th century.By the mid-2020s, the entire world will have become embroiled in the collapse of a sovereign debt bubble that has been building since the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in 1971. At the same time, nation-states and corporations will struggle with the limitations of a fundamentally insecure internet, where emerging technologies and threats will redefine the backbone of commerce and governance. Blockchain technology is key to how this process evolves, as it offers a way to re-architect both the monetary system and the internet networks, devices, and systems our world operates on. This revolution includes everything, from applications for business, government, and democracy, to emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things and even Quantum computing. Blockchain will be a vital tool in how nation-states, corporations, and individuals compete with each other and exercise power in this brave new world.Blockchain 2035 is the first book of its kind, written by the founder of a battle-tested blockchain and a former intelligence analyst. These two perspectives address both the technical and political impacts that this technology will have and how it will be pivotal in the broader world.Jared Tate is the founder of the DigiByte Global Blockchain and the first blockchain creator to write a book on this emerging technology, its potential applications, and how it works. DigiByte is one of the most secure, decentralized, and time tested blockchains on the planet with origins dating back to 2013. Jared has helped pioneer several blockchain applications and technologies, including DigiShield, Digi-ID, DigiAssets, DigiPad, and many more. His code and insights have found their way into dozens of other blockchain protocols and projects. He lives in Austin, TX, where he is actively working on numerous blockchain projects.Andrew Knapp is a former FBI counterterrorism analyst.

9780998076188,"On October 31, 2008, a 9-page white paper written by a person or group named ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" was released. The white paper, called ""Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"" was issued to the subscribers of the cryptography mailing list and described a revolutionary technology that created the world's first genuine peer-to-peer, trustless and decentralized monetary system. The internet-based money enabled online payments without a trusted intermediary or third-party and was also not under the control of a government or corporate entity.   While Bitcoin was the headliner of the white paper, it was not the technology that enabled the peer-to-peer, electronic, cash system to work. That technology was called Blockchain. Ironically, the word blockchain was never mentioned in the white paper but was described in detail. So, in early 2009, Bitcoin was released as a public domain piece of software. Among other capabilities, Blockchain enables trust on the Internet between parties who are anonymous.   Blockchain is indeed a revolutionary capability that put a new spin on how applications could be built going forward. This is why it is impossible to browse the Internet, pick up a newspaper or magazine and not see a headline referencing Blockchain.   One day, Blockchain will be so mainstream that its skeleton will disappear in the same way that electrical wires are part of every wall, but no one notices anymore. But, before then, you should learn what Blockchain is and how it works. Paul Tatro's groundbreaking new book, Blockchain Unchained: The Illustrated Guide to Understanding Blockchain, will help you do exactly that."

9780996025560,"In the US, the services sector provides employment to about 100 million, while the manufacturing sector provides employment to about 20 million. These sectors are highly automated, and driven by sophisticated business processes forming an integral part of the digital economy. While the applications themselves may be distributed over the Internet in time and space, the core business, regulatory, and financial aspects of the digital economy are still centralized, with the need for centralized agencies (such as banks, customs authorities, and tax agencies) to authenticate and settle payments and transactions. These centralized services often are manual, difficult to automate, and represent a bottleneck to facilitating a frictionless digital economy. The next revolutionary step in the services and manufacturing economy of the future is the development of automated distributed applications that do not depend on these traditional centralized agencies for controlling, facilitating and settling multi-party transactions that may themselves be subject to complex contractual constraints. The blockchain technology is an integral part of these next steps that promises a smart new world of automation of complex services and manufacturing processes. Blockchain is a distributed and public ledger which maintains records of all the transactions on a blockchain network comprising suppliers of products and services and consumers. With the blockchain's ability to establish trust in a peer-to-peer network through a distributed consensus mechanism rather than relying on a powerful centralized authority, the technology is being seen by the industry experts as one of the greatest innovations since the invention of the Internet. As per Santander, blockchain technologies can reduce annual costs for financial firms by $20b by streamlining processes and improving efficiency. In addition, investment and spending on blockchain technology is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 52% through 2019. We have written this textbook, as part of our expanding ""A Hands-On Approach""(TM) series, to serve as a textbook for senior-level and graduate-level courses on financial and regulation technologies, business analytics, Internet of Things, and cryptocurrency. This book is also written for use within industries in the FinTech and RegTech space that may be interested in rolling out products and services that utilize this new area of technology. An accompanying website for this book contains additional support for instruction and learning (www.blockchain-book.com). The book is organized into three main parts, comprising a total of ten chapters. Part I provides an introduction to blockchain concepts, design patterns, and architectures for blockchain applications. A blockchain stack comprising a decentralized computation platform, a decentralized messaging platform, and a decentralized storage platform is described. Part II introduces the readers to tools and platforms for blockchain, such as Geth, PyEthApp, TestRPC, Mist Ethereum Wallet, MetaMask, Web3 JavaScript API and the Truffle Dapp framework.

9780674241596,"“Blockchains will matter crucially; this book, beautifully and clearly written for a wide audience, powerfully demonstrates how.”―Lawrence Lessig “Attempts to do for blockchain what the likes of Lawrence Lessig and Tim Wu did for the Internet and cyberspace―explain how a new technology will upend the current legal and social order… Blockchain and the Law is not just a theoretical guide. It’s also a moral one.”―Fortune Bitcoin has been hailed as an Internet marvel and decried as the preferred transaction vehicle for criminals. It has left nearly everyone without a computer science degree confused: how do you “mine” money from ones and zeros? The answer lies in a technology called blockchain. A general-purpose tool for creating secure, decentralized, peer-to-peer applications, blockchain technology has been compared to the Internet in both form and impact. Blockchains are being used to create “smart contracts,” to expedite payments, to make financial instruments, to organize the exchange of data and information, and to facilitate interactions between humans and machines. But by cutting out the middlemen, they run the risk of undermining governmental authorities’ ability to supervise activities in banking, commerce, and the law. As this essential book makes clear, the technology cannot be harnessed productively without new rules and new approaches to legal thinking. “If you…don’t ‘get’ crypto, this is the book-length treatment for you.”―Tyler Cowen, Marginal Revolution “De Filippi and Wright stress that because blockchain is essentially autonomous, it is inflexible, which leaves it vulnerable, once it has been set in motion, to the sort of unforeseen consequences that laws and regulations are best able to address.”―James Ryerson, New York Times Book Review"

The Truth Machine is the best book so far on what has happened and what may come along. It demands the attention of anyone concerned with our economic future."" ―Lawrence H. Summers, Charles W. Eliot University Professor and President Emeritus at Harvard, Former Treasury SecretaryFrom Michael J. Casey and Paul Vigna, the authors of The Age of Cryptocurrency, comes the definitive work on the Internet’s Next Big Thing: The Blockchain.Big banks have grown bigger and more entrenched. Privacy exists only until the next hack. Credit card fraud is a fact of life. Many of the “legacy systems” once designed to make our lives easier and our economy more efficient are no longer up to the task. Yet there is a way past all this―a new kind of operating system with the potential to revolutionize vast swaths of our economy: the blockchain.In The Truth Machine, Michael J. Casey and Paul Vigna demystify the blockchain and explain why it can restore personal control over our data, assets, and identities; grant billions of excluded people access to the global economy; and shift the balance of power to revive society’s faith in itself. They reveal the disruption it promises for industries including finance, tech, legal, and shipping.Casey and Vigna expose the challenge of replacing trusted (and not-so-trusted) institutions on which we’ve relied for centuries with a radical model that bypasses them. The Truth Machine reveals the empowerment possible when self-interested middlemen give way to the transparency of the blockchain, while highlighting the job losses, assertion of special interests, and threat to social cohesion that will accompany this shift. With the same balanced perspective they brought to The Age of Cryptocurrency, Casey and Vigna show why we all must care about the path that blockchain technology takes―moving humanity forward, not backward."

Yes, because its true creator is still unknown today. But rest assured, we'll get there. The idea of creating a new currency came to him in 2008 when, following the Great Depression, he registered the Bitcoin.org domainandthen moved on to the next creation based on fundamental principles such as security, volatility, anonymity and scarcity. For many years now we have been talking about Bitcoin without really knowing its meaning and that is why I am writing this book. The substantial difference between Bitcoin and any other currency such as the dollar, pound sterling or euro is that the former is a virtual currency. Virtual coins cannot be touched, you cannot find them in the usual place where you are looking for banknotes, like the wallet, they almost seem not to exist at all, yet virtual coins will change our life. I spoke in the plural because there are so many virtual coins, but let's focus on the most famous.

It quickly garnered an enthusiastic following who sought to forge a stable and democratic global economy--a world free fromhierarchy and control. In their eyes, Bitcoin's underlying architecture, blockchain, hailed the dawn of decentralisation. Money Code Space shatters these emancipatory claims. In their place, Jack Parkin constructs a new framework for revealing the geographies of power that lie behind blockchain networks. Drawing on first-hand experience in cryptocurrency communities and start-up companies from Silicon Valley to London, Parkin untangles the complex web of culture, politics, and economics that truly drive decentralisation."

9781988025537,"The COVID-19 pandemic has taken precious lives and devastated the global economy. It has also revealed chinks in our supply chains. Not only have manufacturers found themselves scrambling unsuccessfully to find new suppliers when their Asian sources shut down, but the Western world has experienced across-the-board shortages of essential consumer packaged goods for the first time in decades. Blockchain technology has the potential to minimize these kinds of pandemic disruptions.  In this book, some of the world's top experts show how blockchain--in combination with other innovations such as additive manufacturing, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things--can address longstanding problems that make the business of getting goods to customers so slow and expensive, especially in crises. Today's supply chains are complex, as they move resources through trucks, planes, boats, and trains. Too many parties rely on a hodgepodge of documents and intermediaries to do business, which make the whereabouts and custody of goods unclear. That's why, in a pandemic, uninformed consumers might reasonably believe that toilet paper won't be available for many months. Enter blockchain--the Internet of Value. For the first time in human history, individuals and organizations can manage and trade their assets digitally peer to peer. In doing so, they will reinvent global commerce and how we exchange value. This will transform the best practices of operations, logistics, procurement and purchasing, transportation, customs and border control, trade finance and insurance, manufacturing, and inventory management. Global supply chains are ripe for disruption at every level and in every role. Supply Chain Revolution identifies what leaders should be doing now to prepare their organizations for the inevitable decentralized future. Enterprise executives and entrepreneurs alike will find ideas and opportunities to discuss with their stakeholders and decide how best to participate in the blockchain revolution."

Pero  qu  es el blockchain? La cadena de bloques es una tecnolog a que permite interactuar entre los usuarios sin necesidad de intermediarios, garantizando la confidencialidad, autenticidad e integridad de las transacciones.Hay razones que justifican el optimismo de los analistas. En los  ltimos a os, han aparecido nuevos modelos de negocio exitosos basados en plataformas que conectan directamente a los usuarios para hacer negocios. Pensemos, por ejemplo, en Uber. Los analistas creen que es el momento de dar un paso adelante y eliminar a los intermediarios, es decir, de conectar directamente a conductores y usuarios. Las tecnolog as blockchain nos permitir n suprimir la intermediaci n mediante su capacidad de garantizar la integridad de las transacciones. La tecnolog a est  lista, y el mercado quiere desarrollar los nuevos modelos de negocio que empiezan a vislumbrarse. De hecho, uno de los  ltimos informes sobre esta tecnolog a nos habla de un mercado de tama o cercano a los 700 millones de d lares en el 2017, que puede alcanzar los 60.000 millones de d lares si blockchain se convierte realmente en la palanca que permita desplegar nuevas soluciones de soporte a la econom a mundial.Excitante,  no?

9781621575764,"A FINANCIAL TIMES BOOK OF THE MONTH   FROM THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: ""Nothing Mr. Gilder says or writes is ever delivered at anything less than the fullest philosophical decibel... Mr. Gilder sounds less like a tech guru than a poet, and his words tumble out in a romantic cascade.""  ""Google's algorithms assume the world's future is nothing more than the next moment in a random process. George Gilder shows how deep this assumption goes, what motivates people to make it, and why it's wrong: the future depends on human action."" -- Peter Thiel, founder of PayPal and Palantir Technologies and author of Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future  The Age of Google, built on big data and machine intelligence, has been an awesome era. But it's coming to an end. In Life after Google, George Gilder--the peerless visionary of technology and culture--explains why Silicon Valley is suffering a nervous breakdown and what to expect as the post-Google age dawns.  Google's astonishing ability to ""search and sort"" attracts the entire world to its search engine and countless other goodies--videos, maps, email, calendars....And everything it offers is free, or so it seems. Instead of paying directly, users submit to advertising. The system of ""aggregate and advertise"" works--for a while--if you control an empire of data centers, but a market without prices strangles entrepreneurship and turns the Internet into a wasteland of ads.  The crisis is not just economic. Even as advances in artificial intelligence induce delusions of omnipotence and transcendence, Silicon Valley has pretty much given up on security. The Internet firewalls supposedly protecting all those passwords and personal information have proved hopelessly permeable.  The crisis cannot be solved within the current computer and network architecture. The future lies with the ""cryptocosm""--the new architecture of the blockchain and its derivatives. Enabling cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether, NEO and Hashgraph, it will provide the Internet a secure global payments system, ending the aggregate-and-advertise Age of Google.  Silicon Valley, long dominated by a few giants, faces a ""great unbundling,"" which will disperse computer power and commerce and transform the economy and the Internet.  Life after Google is almost here.   For fans of ""Wealth and Poverty,"" ""Knowledge and Power,"" and ""The Scandal of Money."" "

Though it’s best known as the technology that drives bitcoin and other digital cur­rencies, it also has the potential to go far beyond currency, to record virtually everything of value to humankind, from birth and death certifi­cates to insurance claims, land titles, and even votes.  As with major paradigm shifts that preceded it, blockchain technology will create winners and losers.

9781984117335,"Everyone knows that you can buy cryptocurrency without any ID or income statement. However, not many people know that not all altcoins are equally anonymous. A new book by Scott S. Bergman fully reveals the topic of anonymity in the blockchain and altcoins.Transaction anonymity is one of the main reasons for the popularity growth of blockchain technology and a serious advantage of the digital currency in comparison with fiat money. Bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, argued that Bitcoin is an anonymous currency. But by anonymity, he probably meant private. No specific data about you is needed. Meanwhile, the history of all your transactions is stored in the blockchain, and, sooner or later, your wallet and your identity could be linked.Developers of new cryptocurrencies have taken the anonymity requirement into account and use approaches to keep your personal information, transactions and balance anonymous.The book point is:  the author acquaints readers how the blockchain works, explains Bitcoin vulnerability when it comes to transaction anonymity, analyzes and reveals advantages of altcoin anonymity (Dash, ZCash, Monero, Bytecoin, Verge, PIVX).This book will be a great help for everyone who wants to invest wisely and learn about the technology behind a particular altcoin. If the Dash cost no longer allows you to repeat the astounding success of turning a small capital into millions, then some altcoins, such as Verge and Bytecoin, are still worth less than a dollar and, in the long term, could bring investors 500% profit or more.***Amazon will make this Kindle book available to you for FREE ($0.00) when you buy the paperback version from Amazon  ***Recommended for:  For anyone who is interested in cryptocurrencies and wants to understand more about what is behind the terms ""anonymity,"" ""blockchain"" and who wants to assess the prospects for investment in cryptocurrency.Great opportunities go along with some risks. You should analyze, make decisions and invest wisely. The book by financier Scott S. Bergman is a brilliant guide through the cryptocurrency world. It will save you time and will be the first investment that will pay off more than you could ever expect  Buy it now ***Amazon Great Deal: You can read on your PC, Mac, smartphone, tablet or Kindle device. ***tags: altcoins cryptocurrency, altcoins mastery, altcoins, altcoins cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency for beginners, alternative cryptocurrencies, altcoins wallet, blockchain revolution, bitcoin and cryptocurrency technologies, cryptocurrency investing, cryptocurrency, crypto for beginners, altcoin trading, mining altcoins, beyond bitcoin, blockchain, anonymous cryptocurrencies, the investor's guide, cryptocurrency books, cryptocurrency beginners bible, cryptocurrency beginners, cryptocurrency bitcoin, cryptocurrency blockchain, cryptocurrency coin, blockchain books, blockchain technology, blockchain for dummies, blockchain technology explained."

9781548587512,"Traditional currencies operate on a centralized model that is heavily regulated by the national government that issues it. Bitcoin, however, is a decentralized virtual currency that was created in 2008-2009 by a mysterious figure known only as Satoshi Nakamoto.In the years since it has entered the mainstream consciousness; in recent years, its growing popularity has caused its value to SKYROCKET. Bitcoin is not regulated by any centralized institution but rather by the vast peer-to-peer network that enables it to exist and function. This keeps it from being manipulated and/or used to support the interests of a few wealthy, elite individuals in power. In this way, it functions as a ""people's currency."" There is a lot of hype surrounding Bitcoin. It has been featured in news and periodical articles, as well as television shows. It seems to be a buzzword that is quickly becoming embedded in popular culture. Many people have heard of it and know that it is a ""virtual currency,"" but what does that mean? What is a virtual currency? What is Bitcoin even good for, and how can you use it? Bitcoin is used in countries all around the world. Some countries, such as Japan and Switzerland, are openly embracing it and supporting it with government policies that accept it. Other countries, such as the United States, are trying to find ways to regulate it, while others, such as China, have entirely banned any transactions that use Bitcoin under penalty of imprisonment. Because it is such a far-reaching global phenomenon - and continuing to grow by the day - anyone would do well to understand exactly what it is. Many people who explore Bitcoin as a curiosity that they want to understand go on to become Bitcoin investors.Bitcoin is safer than many other financial systems because it is not subject to regulation or manipulation and because of its underlying system, blockchain is inherently resistant to hacks and security breaches that plague other financial institutions. However, there have been infamous hacks of Bitcoin wallets in which people lost large quantities of money. Amongst other things, this book will help you know with confidence how you can remain safe and secure on the Bitcoin network.In this book, you will find basic accurate, detailed information that will help you understand what Bitcoin is, how it is currently being used, and how you can use it to accomplish your own needs, wants, goals, and ambitions. This book will explain everything that you need to know to get started with Bitcoin. Topics covered include: What is Bitcoin?How do you get Bitcoin?What can you do with Bitcoin?The trading processHow does the government get involved?What is blockchain?What is cryptocurrency?How to remain anonymous with Bitcoins Bitcoin secure? What is Bitcoin mining?The future of blockchain, Bitcoin and e-commerceBitcoin tips and suggestions Caveats and warningsThe information presented is both useful and easy to understand. It will answer many of your questions about Bitcoin, and hopefully, inspire some creativity and imagination about how it can be used to help you meet your goals and needs."

我們如何「管理、接觸，和使用資訊」的權利，將決定自由的疆界有多大。
這正是區塊鏈－－這個沒有任何人、或機構
能竄改的「真理機器」，帶給我們莫大力量的原因。

不僅止於社群科技
區塊鏈為什麼還將成為治理社會的新藍圖？ 
本書道破區塊鏈的奧祕，說明它為什麼能恢復我們對個人資料、資產，以及身分的控制權；它讓遭排除在外的數十億人得以進入全球經濟；它轉移權力的天平，重振社會對自身的信心。同時詳述它將帶來的破壞式創新，包括金融、科技，法律與運輸……

當政府跟人民之間、人民與人民之間的信任崩解
詐騙橫行、假新聞流竄，
區塊鏈注定會成為新世代經濟運行的解方？
想像一下：家家戶戶透過屋頂上的太陽能板發電、消費電力－－在一個「去中心化市集」彼此交易能源，不必由公用事業公司制定費率；房地產的買賣雙方與抵押借貸者，不必依賴不可靠的政府登錄契據及優先權紀錄，因為有更值得信賴、無法竄改的去中心化資料庫紀錄交易資訊，貪汙、人為錯誤或盜竊的風險更低……這些只是你所能想像區塊鏈應用的冰山一角。

當「信任」被重新定義之後，
去中心化的「真理」如何為人類帶來更公平的賽場？
本書將展開令人大開眼界的探討！ 區塊鏈背後的概念，已經在全球社會掀起一場角力戰，影響層面之大，沒有人能置身事外。若要翻轉集中式權力的結構，我們就必須先設法了解：控制及管理資訊的能力，是如何轉向一個「沒有人控制」的去中心化系統。它讓我們想像一個不是由Google、臉書，或美國國家安全局（NSA）支配控制的世界，一個我們這些全球社會核心組成份子的普羅大眾，可以對「如何管理我們的資料」有發言權的世界，而本書便是呼籲人們關心、參與的號角。
