From explorations of how it feels to draw and personal accounts of artistic development, to short, imaginative propositions for looking, understanding and experiencing afresh, this collection repositions drawing as a vital creative and intellectual endeavour. The book is divided into three sections: ‘Studio Space’, which focuses on drawing within four walls; ‘Open Space’, which ventures out into the cityscapes and landscapes around us; and ‘Inner Space’, which returns to the living, feeling, drawing person. Each section is comprehensively illustrated with a wealth of drawings, prints and paintings by faculty and alumni of the Royal Drawing School, works by established artists past and present, and photographs of artists at work."

過去市面上缺近此類書籍，本書就是為了幫助讀者解決這樣的問題而產生的，從基本的繪圖技巧、概念如何呈現在草圖中、對於草圖中特別重要的細節要如何配置與加強、應用電腦軟體輔助、再加上相關工具和素材的介紹、製作和呈現面要注意的細節等等，含括筆畫和電腦應用各種方式，一步一步帶領讀者經歷這些「基本功」的打底工作。其中更特別收錄知名設計師的個案介紹，讓讀者在比對設計過程的圖片和最終的實際產品，更能確實了解一件好的設計應具備哪個要點。不僅資料彌足珍貴，更是易懂而實用，是市面上難得一見的書籍。"

Refusing to be restricted to any identity, style or medium, Gupta has constantly probed and expanded the notions of borders, those on paper and within art practice. In the book Drawing in the Dark, we deep dive into her series on the Bengal Borderlands where she traces clandestine routes and flows that persist, despite the near completion of the world's longest border fence between India and Bangladesh. Through interviews, photographs, records with incisions, smuggled everyday objects and drawings made from prohibited cough syrup and marijuana, Gupta's incisive and poetic works unravel stories of desire, mobility and ethics in the face of laws and censorship."

9798708280916,"The Bargue drawing course is one of the most popular classical art drawing courses in the world.Draw from the same Bargue art plates as artistic masters like Pablo Picasso and Vincent van Gogh and thousands more artists.Traditionally the art student would copy master drawings and then plaster casts of sculptures and monuments and then finally from life.The Charles Bargue master drawings are a series of prints ranging from simple to more advanced drawing. Training the eye of the student to understand the effects of light and shadow, the illusion of form.I totally support the point of view of French art teachers of the 19th century that fine art students need to study the rich traditions of the classical art.French schools at that time advocated the following sequence of art education: Drawing copies of classical art platesCopying drawings by the Old MastersDrawing classical casts - busts and figuresDrawing live modelsThe 20th century brought various ""isms"" into art, and many art students become disillusioned with art education as it is practiced today.Copying the Old Masters and studying their art is an important part of traditional art education. Copying classical masterpieces will develop a proper artistic taste and style. I believe that thousands of fine art students will improve greatly from such exercises. These plates were created as a part of an intensive drawing course system designed by the late great draftsman, artist, and painter Charles BargueDuring my atelier training these lessons were integrated in the curriculum (as I'd imagine with most ateliers around the world) and taught as a means of refinement of observational skills in the practice of drawing.Benefits are perpetual in the entire scope of the artist's development.To have the ability to accurately record what the eye sees removing deviation or mental hindrance, I'd say is the basic principle behind this drawing system.Once this is gained the artist is in a better position to integrate their imagination in a precision controlled manner.Should you buy a copy of this book?If you're really serious about improving drawing skills, and you're willing to put in some hard hours of practice, then yes, you should definitely buy it.If you just love drawing and have cash to burn, you should buy it.If you're in the habit of buying art instruction books but you cant really draw that much, this book isn't going to magically help you draw better.But neither is any art book.Charles Bargue is mostly remembered for his ""Cours de dessin"", one of the most influential classical drawing courses conceived in collaboration with Jean-Léon Gérôme. The course, published between 1866 and 1871 by Goupil & Cie, comprised 197 lithographs printed as individual sheets, was to guide students from plaster casts to the study of great master drawings and finally to drawing from the living model. The Charles Bargue Drawing Course is used by many academies and ateliers which focus on Classical Realism. Among the artists whose work is based on the study of Bargue's plate work are Pablo Picasso and Vincent van Gogh, who copied the complete set in 1880/1881, and (at least a part of it) again in 1890.This book contains the plates from the original ""Cours de dessin"" digitally restored to more faithfully represent the original plates as they appeared when new. Also included are some example drawings from original Bargue students. Finally there is the complete collection of Bargue figure drawings making this a complete set of drawing plates exceeding those in the basic course."

9781911339342,"With an artistic mindset, we don't always draw what we can't see. And because we don't draw it, we can't fully understand it. - Kurt Ofer To challenge this restricted outlook, architect Kurt Ofer has formulated an utterly unique way of drawing, which gives a superior understanding of form. By following the method of ""transparent drawing,"" you ignore an object's opacity and see beyond its surface, allowing you to draw it in a very distinct and holistic way. This allows us to fully see and understand the object, and brings unimaginable results. Transparent Drawing will appeal to anyone who has ever picked up a pencil and made marks on a piece of paper. The book questions why we draw, but it is not a book on how to draw. It is clear that through Ofer's detailed exploration of various drawing movements through history, taking into account prominent thinkers and philosophers, the purpose of the book is not only to advance a new mode of drawing, but to enrich readers with a knowledge, which gives a previously inconceivable outcome when put into practice."

9781420971163,"First published in 1924, ""Bridgman's Life Drawing"" is famed art instructor George Bridgman's instructive course on drawing the human anatomy. Bridgman was born in Canada in 1865, but lived most of his life in the United States and studied under painter and sculptor Jean-L on G r me at the  cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, as well as under the famed painter Gustave Boulanger. Bridgman had a long and illustrious career as a teacher of anatomy and figure drawing at the Art Students League of New York. He taught thousands of students over many years, including numerous notable artists such as Norman Rockwell, Will Eisner, Elizabeth Cady Stanton Blake, and Archie Boyd Teater. In ""Bridgman's Life Drawing"" we find the synthesis of his technique on how to draw the human figure. Bridgman instructs that students must first gain a sense of the movement of the human form by understanding the underlying structure. From this the realistic portrayal of the human figure can be done by building up the form with consideration of light and shadow. Bridgman in turn breaks down the different parts of the anatomy to create a complete instruction manual on life drawing. This edition is printed on premium acid-free paper."

9780374261962," The Shadow Drawing] reorients our perspective, distills a life and brings it into focus--the very work of revision and refining that its subject loved best. --Parul Sehgal, The New York Times Editors' ChoiceAn entirely new account of Leonardo the artist and Leonardo the scientist, and why they were one and the same man  Leonardo da Vinci has long been celebrated for his consummate genius. He was the painter who gave us the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, and the inventor who anticipated the advent of airplanes, hot air balloons, and other technological marvels. But what was the connection between Leonardo the painter and Leonardo the scientist? Historians of Renaissance art have long supposed that Leonardo became increasingly interested in science as he grew older and turned his insatiable curiosity in new directions. They have argued that there are, in effect, two Leonardos--an artist and an inventor.  In this pathbreaking new interpretation, the art historian Francesca Fiorani offers a different view. Taking a fresh look at Leonardo's celebrated but challenging notebooks, as well as other sources, Fiorani argues that Leonardo became familiar with advanced thinking about human vision when he was still an apprentice in a Florence studio--and used his understanding of optical science to develop and perfect his painting techniques. For Leonardo, the task of the painter was to capture the interior life of a human subject, to paint the soul. And even at the outset of his career, he believed that mastering the scientific study of light, shadow, and the atmosphere was essential to doing so. Eventually, he set down these ideas in a book--A Treatise on Painting--that he considered his greatest achievement, though it would be disfigured, ignored, and lost in subsequent centuries.  Ranging from the teeming streets of Florence to the most delicate brushstrokes on the surface of the Mona Lisa, The Shadow Drawing vividly reconstructs Leonardo's life while teaching us to look anew at his greatest paintings. The result is both stirring biography and a bold reconsideration of how the Renaissance understood science and art--and of what was lost when that understanding was forgotten."

But it is that blank sheet of paper that sets off the ""what do I draw?"" and ""I don't know how to draw it "" panic. That is where 365 Days of Drawing comes in.  There is a step-by-step drawing exercise for every day of the year. Each shows the steps from the first line to the last and a brief text explains the steps. You can move through the book front to back or pick and choose. All 365 drawings start with one shape or line -- a circle, an oval, a square, a rectangle, a curved line, a straight line -- upon which the object or person is built. By mixing these basic strokes anything is achievable.  The reader can add perspective to go from two- to three-dimensions: create volume turning a square into a box, add depth turning a circle into a cylinder, create distance making railway tracks disappear. A one-quarter view of a box is different than from the front, and an open box even more different.  Facial features can be a beginning drawer's nightmare but not if you know the lines of halves and thirds on which all faces are drawn. At the same time, you will learn anatomy and what goes where when someone is walking, bowling, sleeping, or more. In all, there are more than 50 drawings of people in various poses.  The variety is impressive just by using the basic shapes and lines:  all straight lines for a xylophone, an Egyptian pyramid, a house   all curved lines for a rhinoceros, a high-heeled shoe, a crying baby  curved lines mixed with straight lines for a jetliner, a city center, a tennis racket.   With its abundance of approachable drawings as well as loads of tips, instruction and inspiration, 365 Days of Drawing will have even the most artistically challenged mastering the art of drawing. Those with experience can use daily challenges to polish their skills. "

9780819579065,"Colorful mappings of choreographic ideas Soloing on the page, choreographer Annie-B Parson rethinks choreography as dance on paper. Parson draws her dances into new graphic structures calling attention to the visual facts of the materiality of each dance work she has made. These drawings serve as both maps of her pieces in the aftermath of performance, and a consideration of the elements of dance itself. Divided into three chapters, the book opens with diagrams of the objects in each of her pieces grouped into chart-structures. These charts reconsider her dances both from the perspective of the resonance of things, and for their abstract compositional properties. In chapter two, Parson delves into the choreographic mind, charting such ideas as an equality in the perception of objects and movement, and the poetics of a kinetic grammar. Charts of erasure, layering and language serve as dynamic and prismatic tools for dance making. Lastly, nodding to the history of chance operations in dance, Parson creates a generative card game of 52 compositional elements for artists of any medium to cut out and play as a method for creating new material. Within the duality of form and content, this book explores the meanings that form itself holds, and Parson's visual maps of choreographic ideas inspire new thinking around the shared elements underneath all art making."

9781580935135,"The best way to learn about art is to make it. Discover the secrets of great figure drawing as you sketch along with past and present masters. This working artist's sketchbook guides you from beginning gestures to delicate rendering. It's your art, your tradition, your time. Take your voice and add it to the tradition as if the history of art has saved the best for now.-- Juliette Aristides Figure Drawing Atelier offers a comprehensive, contemporary twist to the very traditional atelier approach to the methods that instruct artists on the techniques they need to successfully draw and ultimately paint the figure. The book offers art instruction, practical and progressive lessons on drawing the figure, and high-quality sketchbook paper in a beautiful package that includes blank pages for sketching and copying. Artists will then have a record of their process, like with a sketchbook, which many artists like to document and save. In this elegant and inspiring workbook, master contemporary artist and author Juliette Aristides breaks down the figure drawing process into small, manageable lessons, presents them progressively, introduces time-tested principles and techniques in the atelier tradition that are easily accessible, and shares the language and context necessary to understand the artistic process and create superior, well-crafted drawings. Atelier education is centered on the belief that working in a studio, not sitting in the lecture hall, is the best way to learn about art. Every artist needs to learn to master figure drawing. Ateliers have produced the greatest artists of all time--and now that educational model is experiencing a renaissance. These studios, a return to classical art training, are based on the nineteenth-century model of teaching artists by pairing them with a master artist over a period of years. Students begin by copying masterworks, then gradually progress to painting as their skills develop. Figure Drawing Atelier is like having an atelier in a book--and the master is Juliette Aristides, a classically trained artist and best-selling art-instruction author with almost rock star popularity in the contemporary world of representational art. On every page, Aristides uses the works of Old Masters and today's most respected realist artists to demonstrate and teach the principles of realistic figure drawing and painting, taking students step by step through the learning curve yet allowing them to work at their own pace. Unique and inspiring, this book offers a serious art course for serious art students and beginners alike."

9780486832425,"""Drawing D-Day powerfully and poignantly reflects back on the watershed event of the 20th century in a way that is unexpected and completely unique."" -- Jeffery R. Fulgham, CFRE, Vice President, Finance and Development, National D-Day Memorial Foundation Drawing D-Day: An Artist's Journey Through War offers an extraordinary, one-of-a-kind testimony in words and images by a soldier and artist who participated in one of the most famous military operations of World War II. On June 6, 1944, Ugo Giannini landed on Omaha Beach with a platoon of military police assigned to accompany the U.S. Army's 29th Infantry Division. Only six of the thirty-seven men in the platoon made it to the beach. Told that he was needed on the bluff above the shore, Ugo climbed the Verville Draw, jumped into a crater made by naval bombardment, and spent that day and part of the next as an eyewitness to the invasion. Remarkably, he began to draw.  These are the only known drawings from that historic day. Drawn in pencil and pen, in a gritty, realist style, the images depict heavily burdened infantrymen trying to stay afloat in seawater, crawling on the beach, and dead among the ruins of a bombed-out village. The illustrations, interwoven with Ugo's letters to his family and girlfriend, portray the horror of war in a deep and personal way. Abstract paintings at the end of the book, composed forty years later, make a powerful statement of the enduring power about war on an artist-soldier's psyche."
9781580935128,"Written by a well-known artist and best-selling art-instruction author with almost rock-star popularity in the contemporary world of representational art, Beginning Drawing Atelier, with its unique workbook/sketchbook approach, and high-quality paper, offers a comprehensive and contemporary twist on traditional Atelier art instruction practices. Atelier education is centered on the belief that working in a studio, not sitting in the lecture hall, is the best place to learn about art. Every artist needs to learn basic drawing skills. In this elegant and inspiring workbook, master contemporary artist and best selling author Juliette Aristides breaks down the drawing process into small, manageable lessons; presents them progressively; introduces time-tested principles and techniques in the Atelier tradition that are easily accessible; and shares the language and context necessary to understand the artistic process and create superior, well-crafted drawings. What makes this approach unique is the fact that it includes blank pages for copying and practicing within each lesson, facilitating traditional Atelier methods. Ateliers have produced the greatest artists of all time--and now that educational model is experiencing a renaissance. These studios, in a return to classical art training, are based on the nineteenth-century model of teaching artists by pairing them with a master artist over a period of years. Students begin by copying masterworks, then gradually progress to painting as their skills develop. Beginning Drawing Atelier is like having an atelier in a book--and the master is Juliette Aristides, a classically trained artist. On every page, Aristides uses the works of Old Masters and today's most respected realist artists to demonstrate and teach the principles of realist drawing and painting, taking students step by step through the learning curve yet allowing them to work at their own pace. Unique and inspiring, the approach in this new book offers serious art courses for serious art students."

9781782215127,"Artist Tim Pond's lively and engaging book fuses science with art, providing the reader with the skills, techniques and knowledge they need to create sketches of animals filled with life and movement. There are some very good books written on life drawing, yet when it comes to drawing wildlife, illustrators and artists often revert to working solely from photographs, which can leave the artwork looking lifeless and flat. In this inspirational book, artist Tim Pond shows you how to observe and draw animals in zoos, farms, wildlife parks and aquariums, teaching you some fascinating facts about the animals along the way and ultimately bringing you closer to nature. One of the challenges with sketching wildlife is that animals are constantly moving, however having some basic understanding of the biology of an animal, such as knowing that a duck has a cheek or that a cheetah can't retract its claws, can influence how you might sketch them, and results in a lively drawing that captures the form, movement and ultimately the spirit of the animal in question. Combining scientific knowledge with expert practical guidance is key to creating successful drawings of animals, and Tim's ability to convey this in a way that is both accessible and engaging makes this a unique and inspiring guide suitable for artists of all levels. Tim's book takes you on a journey of discovery that will enable you to develop the skills, techniques and knowledge you need to sketch a broad range of wildlife, encompassing mammals, reptiles, birds, fish and insects. It includes quick, gestural sketches as well as linear and tonal studies, in a variety of media - pencil, pen and ink, and watercolour. There are numerous studies comprising how to represent the different patterns of animals' coats, how to capture the plumage of an exotic bird in watercolour, and how to sketch a hippo's hooves, as well as guidance on tools, materials and basic techniques. The result is a treasure chest of fascinating facts, studies, sketches and annotated drawings that will not fail to ignite your enthusiasm for drawing animals from life."

Within three years his unit, a tough collection of depression era cowboys, farmers, and more than a thousand Native Americans, would land in Europe--there to distinguish themselves as, in the words of General George Patton, ""one of the best, if not the best division, in the history of American arms."" During his service with the 45th Infantry, the vaunted Thunderbirds, Echohawk tapped the talent he had honed at Pawnee boarding school to document the conflict in dozens of annotated sketches. These combat sketches form the basis of Echohawk's memoir of service with the Thunderbirds in World War II. In scene after scene he re-creates acts of bravery and moments of terror as he and his fellow soldiers fight their way through key battles at Sicily, Salerno, and Anzio. Woven with Pawnee legend and language and quickened with wry Native wit, Drawing Fire conveys in a singular way what it was like to go to war alongside a band of Indian brothers. It stands as a tribute to those Echohawk fought with and those he lost, a sharply observed and deeply felt picture of men at arms--capturing for all time the enduring spirit and steadfast strength of the Native American warrior."

Follow along step-by-step with internationally acclaimed iconographer Joseph Malham as he takes you through an eight-day, self-guided contemplative retreat to create your own icon of the Christ Pantocrator (All-Powerful, the Teacher). In Drawing Closer to Christ, Malham relies on his twenty years of teaching experience to walk you through the materials and techniques needed to create your own sacred image.

The forms have symmetry--balance between left and right, above and below--connecting center to periphery, providing stability and harmony. The forms are rhythmic, having a pattern that moves in flowing shapes and lines. Other forms are organic, as drawing organically inspired forms such as flowers helps one experience nature's colors and designs. Flowers provide inspiring ideas for color combinations and for new forms. Originally developed by Rudolf Steiner, creative form drawing is widely used in Waldorf-inspired education to support healthy child development and learning. ∞ ∞ ∞ CONTENTS Introduction: How To Use This Book; 86 pages of creative color forms, each sequenced for step-by-step drawing, culminating in twelve fourfold variations based on a coin. There is plenty of space on each page for your own work; and an afterword on creative form drawing."

9781440337567,"An intuitive approach for figure artists to get proportions right.  Traditional methods of measuring body proportions rely on the abstract memorization of convoluted fractions or multiples of the human head. But artists shouldn't have to be mathematicians. Figure Drawing in Proportion introduces a better, more intuitive, less intimidating way to get proportions right. It starts with the revelation that--despite the wonderful variety of bodies in this world--the human figure has standard size relationships artists can build upon for accurate renderings. If you know, for example, that the collarbone is the same width as the head, it's much easier to draw the head in proper relationship to the shoulders. Knowing that the palm should be the same width as the knee helps establish the correct relationships in a seated portrait. This book highlights dozens of such key internal and comparative measurements. Once you start looking, you will discover even more. Ideal for any level of artist, this practical approach to proportions makes figure drawing more approachable and more rewarding. Inside you'll find:  - 9 full step-by-step demonstrations, using various poses and figures to show proportioning techniques in practice. - Internal and comparative measurements and how to apply them to figure drawings. - Simple strategies for recalling key proportions as you work."

9781603063630,"In this provocative essay, the authors explore how John Trumbull, famed painter of the American Revolutionary War period, came to make sketches of five Creek Indian leaders in New York in 1790. They also argue that one of the Indian chiefs has been misidentified and show that Trumbull's own notes and inscriptions point to the correct name. By chance, Trumbull was painting George Washington's portrait for the City of New York when a delegation of Creeks arrived to sign the Treaty of New York. Finding himself in the company of the Creeks, the artist seized the opportunity to draw them. While Drawing By Stealth tells the history of these iconic drawings of American Indians, it also provides details about the clothing and ornaments depicted and corrects a popular -- but erroneous -- theory that one of the images is of the leader of the Creek delegation to New York, Alexander McGillivray."

9781530524204,"      Learning how to draw can be easy when you are shown correctly right from the start. So why not learn from the master teacher who is credited to have inspired Walt Disney to start drawing and pursue his animating career.      &nbspAuthor and illustrator Edwin George Lutz is the man, and he is famous for his method of breaking down complex illustrations into simple step-by-step stages that anyone can follow. Many fine artists and illustrators over the decades have used his technique, and this classic book will teach you how as well.     &nbspThis current course has been derived from Lutz's century old book ""What To Draw And How To Draw It"" first published in 1913. We have made it into a workbook format, with blank practice pages to do the drawing exercises. Of course you can use your own drawing paper if you don't want to draw in the book, and this will also prevent or minimize imprints of the pencil tip on other exercise pages. And for further drawing convenience the publisher grants permission to photocopy pages for personal use.     &nbsp- Ideal gift for children.     &nbsp- Learn from this timeless classic that has inspired so many children and adults alike to create their own beautiful works of art.     &nbsp- Simple to follow, yet for budding artists of all ages leads to enviable drawing skills.     &nbsp- Step-by-step technique takes a blank page to a finished drawing using principles seen in sophisticated artwork and animations today.     &nbsp- Fast progression in skill level with this method that uses gradual, simplified stages to build a finished piece of artwork.      &nbspIn this remarkable course you will learn to draw a fantastic range of subjects and objects, from people and faces, through to animals, birds, insects, fish and many other different kinds of things, such as toys, buildings and landscapes.     &nbspThis book is aimed at teaching children (although it's great for any beginner no matter the age), and the choice of pictures is designed to keep a child fascinated. There are over one hundred pictures to draw,  and the method makes for a magical experience making drawing easy and delightfully interesting.     &nbspThe book provides a step-by-step system that fixes the object in memory and develops naturally a physical skill and a memorized knowledge of proportion and form. Foreshortening and perspective, often bugbears to young artists, are overcome by the simplest progressive examples. Images are broken down into simple key-lines, which are then built upon with clear step-by-step instructions, resulting in impressive drawings.     &nbspInstructions are very brief, for the key-lines of each object tell their own story and the child is entranced by the results soon gained. The youngest child may grasp the magic progress of this way of working and he or she will quickly learn to draw the picture naturally and well.     &nbspWe think anyone who applies the knowledge contained within this course will be delighted with their results, and the speed and ease at which they attain them."

We have thousands of titles available, and we invite you to search for us by name, contact us via our website, or download our most recent catalogues. OUT OF THE FLESH of our mothers come dreams and memories of the Gods. Of other kind than the normal inducement of interest and increasing skill, there exists a continual pressure upon the artist of which he is sometimes partially conscious but rarely entirely aware. He learns early or late in his career that power of literal reproduction (such as that of the photographic apparatus) is not more than slightly useful to him. He is compelled to find out from his artist predecessors the existence, in representation of real form, of super-sessions of immediate accuracies; he discovers within himself a selective conscience and he is satisfied, normally, in large measure by the extensive field afforded by this broadened and simplified beyond this is a region and that a much greater one, for exploration. The objective understanding, as we see, has to be attacked by the artist and a subconscious method, for correction of conscious visual accuracy, must be used. No amount of manual skill and consciousness of error will produce good drawing. A recent book on drawing by a well-known painter is a case in point; there the examples of masters of draughtsmanship may be compared with the painter-author's own, side by side, and the futility of mere skill and interest examined. Therefore to proceed further, it is necessary to dispose of the subject in art also (that is to say the subject in the illustrative or complex sense). Thus to clear the mind of inessentials permits through a clear and transparent medium, without prepossessions of any kind, the most definite and simple forms and ideas to attain expression."

9781477302118,"For thousands of years, Native Americans throughout the Eastern Woodlands and Great Plains used the physical act and visual language of tattooing to construct and reinforce the identity of individuals and their place within society and the cosmos. The act of tattooing served as a rite of passage and supplication, while the composition and use of ancestral tattoo bundles was intimately related to group identity. The resulting symbols and imagery inscribed on the body held important social, civil, military, and ritual connotations within Native American society. Yet despite the cultural importance that tattooing held for prehistoric and early historic Native Americans, modern scholars have only recently begun to consider the implications of ancient Native American tattooing and assign tattooed symbols the same significance as imagery inscribed on pottery, shell, copper, and stone.Drawing with Great Needles is the first book-length scholarly examination into the antiquity, meaning, and significance of Native American tattooing in the Eastern Woodlands and Great Plains. The contributors use a variety of approaches, including ethnohistorical and ethnographic accounts, ancient art, evidence of tattooing in the archaeological record, historic portraiture, tattoo tools and toolkits, gender roles, and the meanings that specific tattoos held for Dhegiha Sioux and other Native speakers, to examine Native American tattoo traditions. Their findings add an important new dimension to our understanding of ancient and early historic Native American society in the Eastern Woodlands and Great Plains."

Ted Seth Jacobs offers personal reflections and advice on developing the ability to draw what the eye sees rather than what the mind dictates. More than 180 black-and-white drawings and eight pages of color illustrations reinforce his insights into such concepts as light, balance, and symmetry. Jacobs' mental approaches include drawing as a philosophical expression, encouraging the mind and body to work together, and cultivating a relaxed but attentive mood. His observations on figure drawing range from the portrayal of forms in action and at rest to draped effects; and he explores the nature of shadow, reflected light, and other light-related issues. Above all, he encourages readers to challenge all assumptions about drawing and painting. A valuable teaching tool for students, this volume is also an excellent reference for professionals and amateurs."

9781495999994,"If you are an artist in search of further knowledge about drawing to enhance your skills, then this is not the book for you. This book is for the individuals who wants to be an artist but know nothing about drawing. I know how it feels when you want to illustrate an idea but you just don't know how to start. And when you finally grabbed the confidence to mark that paper but then it turned out really terrible and you didn't want to show it to anyone. Table of contents INTRODUCTION GETTING STARTED -How to grip a pencil properly -Warming up SKETCHING -Starting with sticks and shapes DETAILING -Design -Texture SHADING -Casting shadows -Hatching -Cross-hatching -Scumbling -Stippling -Smudging and layering Smudging Layering This instructional manual is for making the 'two circles' cat of yours into something more pleasing and distinguishable, for enhancing that sheep which looks like a cloud with a face, for turning your stick figures into cartoons, and more. Learn the very basics of drawing easily by following this step-by-step tutorial and realize that drawing is something that is fun to do, and not something that becomes a cause of frustration. To give you a hint of what this book is all about, look at this short list of tasks that you will learn to properly initiate after reading and following the tutorial. Tasks: -Start with a loose sketch. You need to define the first look of your drawing by sketching it first so it could serve as a pattern for your permanent outlines (defined outlines). If the lay-out of your primary sketch is too far-off from the final piece that you are after, the latter parts are going to be difficult. -Define permanent outlines. Trace your sketch to clearly define the contour shape (primary shape) of your drawing, and clean it up by erasing the sketch markings. -Show/illustrate some texture. Texture contour provides a better portrayal of the shape's dimension values. The details such as scales, fur or any print and texture should curve and flow with the contour shape of your subject and adjust with it accordingly. -Draw the necessary details. Use a variety of line thickness and line weight (given pressure on the pencil) to show the right balance to the whole drawing, use thick lines for the parts that should visually dominate the drawing, and less visible and thin lines for the secondary details and parts that merely describe the object/subject's form."

Every time the artist takes their eyes off of the model or scene and looks at their paper or canvas, their visual memory is involved. What if that artist's visual memory was highly trained? That artist might need the model for a shorter period of time, or she might have a more productive time when the model is in pose. He might be better at painting all of the fleeting effects that nature throws at us when we are landscape painting en plein air.  Memory Drawing: Perceptual Training and Recall exists to guide you in doing just that. It will also help you improve your abilities to remember fleeting effects, seize essentials, and even enhance your imagination."

9780300169379,"As the focal point of numerous high-profile exhibitions, the sculpture of Richard Serra (b. 1939) has drawn international acclaim. Yet even those who have marveled at Serra's intellectually rigorous and large works of sculpture may not be familiar with his equally intriguing drawings. This handsome book brings together for the first time Serra's drawn work, considering the artist's investigation of medium as an activity both independent from and linked to his pioneering sculptural practice. First working in ink, charcoal, and lithographic crayon on paper, Serra originally used drawing as a means to explore form and perceptual relations between his sculpture and the viewer. Over time, his drawings underwent significant shifts in concept, materials, and scale and became fully realized and autonomous works of art. The grand, bold forms he created with black paintstick in his monumental Installation Drawings were designed to disrupt and complement existent spaces and eventually began to occupy entire rooms. In the late 1980s, Serra explored the tension of weight and gravity through layering, and his most recent work experiments with surface effects, using mesh screens as intermediaries between the gesture and the transfer of pigment to paper."

Pass  notions that once defined drawing as being a preparatory stage for painting or sculpture have long since been cast aside. Drawing is now fully recognized as its own art form--in the biennials, art fairs, museum exhibitions, and beyond. Drawing has come of age. Contemporary artists are increasingly discovering that drawing is something unique and different from painting. It is an intense, sensitive, compelling, personal, and utterly direct art form, one with its own concepts, characteristics, and techniques. In addition, contemporary drawing is not governed by any particular imagery, but rather encompasses a variety of approaches, including realist, abstract, modernist, and post-modernist. Contemporary Drawing delves into the essential and far-reaching concepts of this medium, exploring surface, mark, space, composition, scale, materials, and intentionality in turn. Key techniques, such as using nature to induce marks and working with a checklist to determine a drawing's problems, are introduced throughout. Plus, an in-depth chapter examines a number of artists, such as William Kentridge and Gego, who are breaking traditional boundaries that separate one artistic discipline from another. Lushly illustrated by a wide range of highly accomplished contemporary artists, Contemporary Drawing offers a broad perspective on this expansive and energized field of art."

Now, with this illustrated, practical record of his teachings, readers can benefit from the depth and variety of Sloan's talks on art theory and practice.Transcribed and edited by Helen Farr, a student whom Sloan later married, the discussions begin with observations on drawing as the basis of visual art, including considerations of line, tone, texture, light and shade, composition, design, space, perspective, and related issues. Later chapters deal with figure drawing, painting, landscape and mural painting, painting technique (gesso grounds, tempera, and glazing), etching, and other media (aquatint, lithography, and watercolor). Sloan's discussion of color in the chapter on oil painting is especially detailed, with notes on harmony, use of set palettes, underpainting and glazing, line work, and much more.Each chapter features a wealth of helpful suggestions and recommended exercise, along with Sloan's personal opinions of D rer, Rubens, El Greco, and other masters, and his insights into their work: ""Go to the masters to learn how to draw and paint.

DuBois prophesied that the colour line would be the key problem of the twentieth-century and he later identified one of its key dynamics: the new religion of whiteness that was sweeping the world. Whereas most historians have confined their studies of race-relations to a national framework, this book studies the transnational circulation of people and ideas, racial knowledge and technologies that under-pinned the construction of self-styled white men's countries from South Africa, to North America and Australasia. Marilyn Lake and Henry Reynolds show how in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century these countries worked in solidarity to exclude those they defined as not-white, actions that provoked a long international struggle for racial equality. Their findings make clear the centrality of struggles around mobility and sovereignty to modern formulations of both race and human rights."

9780738208107,"One of those rare books that can change the reader's view of our position in the world and within the animal kingdom, Unlocking the Cage is a landmark both in its scientific insight and in its challenge to the law. As Steven Wise continues his exploration of animal cognition along the evolutionary spectrum -- from apes to dolphins, parrots, elephants, dogs, and even honeybees -- he finds astonishing answers to the big question in animal rights today: Where do we draw the line? The law has firm criteria for personhood and Wise shows how certain non-human animals meet those criteria. Readers will be enthralled as they follow Wise's firsthand investigations of the work of the world's most famous animal experts: in Kenya with Cynthia Moss and the touchingly affectionate elephant families of Amboseli, in the mountains of Uganda with Richard Wrangham and the chimpanzees of the Kibale Forest, at MIT with Irene Pepperberg and her amazing and witty gray parrot, Alex, and in the California sanctuary where Penny Paterson has spent two decades learning about the skills and vivid personality of Koko the gorilla. In many cases, Wise was even able to sustain an extended conversation with these extraordinary creatures. Steven Wise is the world's foremost expert on the legal rights of animals and has devoted his life to litigating, writing, and working on their behalf. No one with a shred of curiosity about animals, about rights, or about justice will want to miss this book. A Merloyd Lawrence Book"

That's true physically. It's true spiritually as well. If we neglect to regularly feed our souls on the Holy Scriptures, our faith becomes weak and we start to lose touch with our Savior. Growth is stifled... if it happens at all. Drawing Near, used daily in combination with God's Holy Word, can not only help bring you closer to God but also keep you from spiritual stagnation. This book will guide you in a growing relationship with Him. As Pastor MacArthur says in his Introduction: Our entertainment-conscious, quick-fix, fast-food society does everything it can to divert us from setting aside time to study God's Word. As you well know from your own efforts, Bible study is not often entertaining--it's hard work. It takes discipline to set aside time each day to reap the benefits such study has to offer. If you reach an impasse when it's time to sit down, open your Bible, and try to decide what to do, you're not alone. Without some plan to follow, it's easy to become frustrated and eventually give up after only one or two days. That's where this book comes in. If you desire greater understanding of the precious Word of God, if you want a daily guide to draw you closer to the Lord, this outstanding collections of 365 devotional readings by one of America's most respected and trusted Bible teachers is for you "
9780486418018,"Compact but comprehensive, this manual contains the best information available on pencil and ink techniques. Written and beautifully illustrated by an acclaimed artist and advertising illustrator, it's the perfect companion for artists seeking a guide to the variety of techniques and media for rendering their ideas on paper.Pencil drawing and ink drawing receive separate treatments; both sections stress materials and tools -- including graphite pencils, charcoal and pastel pencils, wax pencils, pens, brushes, marking pens, scratching tools, and more. They also explore different methods of handling strokes and lines, techniques for stabling and conveying tones and shadows, and technical tips. The 28 step-by-step demonstrations -- many of them exquisitely illustrated in full color -- range from techniques of fine penwork and cross-hatching to drawing with colored inks and colored markers.

9780486418025,"Many art students and professionals have mastered the art of depicting unclothed figures, but still have trouble accurately rendering clothing or other forms of draped cloth. Part of the problem -- before this book came along -- was that there was a lack of concise and simple instruction on the subject, and much that was written was too vague to be helpful. This comprehensive, well-illustrated book was created to solve the problem.In these pages George Bridgman -- a longtime instructor at New York's Art Student League and one of the nation's foremost teachers of figure drawing -- offers expert advice on depicting draped figures. Clothing is none other than a drapery arranged around a body that is beneath it. To express the multitudinous forms it takes, one should learn to express in a direct way the different characters of folds, for each one plays its individual part as distinctly apart as actors play their different characters upon the stage.Students learn the characteristics of seven different kinds of folds and how to render them, including pipe, zigzag, spiral, half-lock, diaper pattern, drop, and inert folds. Mastery of these principles is the key to realistic portrayal of garments, as well as the proper rendering of cloth in still lifes. The straightforward, easy-to-follow text is illustrated by 200 of Bridgman's own sketches and diagrams, reproduced from pencil renderings in crisp halftones. Art students, teachers, and professionals alike are sure to welcome this inexpensive republication of a practical, hands-on manual by a master of figure drawing."

9780865681620,"Japanese Sword Drawing is a complete guide to this esoteric aspect of sword fighting. Written by a noted master, this volume describes the techniques and katas of Muso Shinden Ryu.Muso Shinden Ryu was founded by the great master Hayashi Jinsuke Shigenobu in the 16th century. Since that time, a succession of masters have guided the progress of the school, often adding katas and modifying techniques as their experiences dictated.Illustrated with nearly 800 photographs, this book records many iaido forms that thus far have only been orally transmitted. It documents the three styles of sword-drawing taught in the Muso Shinden Ryu system, each of which is actually a complete art of sword-drawing in itself. In addition, the sei tei kata (official forms) of the All-Japan Fencing Federation and the All-Japan Sword-Drawing Federation are described in detail."
9780823003037,"Many of us want to learn ""how to draw."" But as artist Anthony Ryder explains, it's much more important to learn what to draw. In other words, to observe and draw what we actually see, rather than what we think we see. When it comes to drawing the human figure, this means letting go of learned ideas and expectation of what the figure should look like. It means carefully observing the interplay of form and light, shape and line, that combine to create the actual appearance of human form. In The Artist's Complete Guide to Figure Drawing, amateur and experienced artists alike are guided toward this new way of seeing and drawing the figure with a three-step drawing method. The book's progressive course starts with the block-in, an exercise in seeing and establishing the figure's shape. It then build to the contour, a refined line drawing that represents the figure's silhouette. The last step is tonal work on the inside of the contour, when light and shadow are shaped to create the illusion of form. Separate chapters explore topics critical to the method: gesture, which expresses a sense of living energy to the figure; light, which largely determines how we see the model; and form, which conveys the figure's volume and mass. Examples, step-by-steps, and special ""tips"" offer helpful hints and practical guidance throughout. Lavishly illustrated with the author's stunning artwork, The Artist's Complete Guide to Figure Drawing combines solid instruction with thoughtful meditations on the art of drawing, to both instruct and inspire artists of all levels."

9780486282688,"""The guidance to be found within these covers reflects the author's inspired ability as a teacher and artist of the highest magnitude. It is probably the finest book on the subject of drawing the human form that I have ever seen."" -- Irving Shapiro, A.W.S., Director, American Academy of ArtThis unique guide offers a bold, innovative approach to drawing from life. Instead of teaching the traditional method of building up a drawing from lines, leaving mass and tone till later, noted art instructor Douglas R. Graves takes precisely the opposite tack. The student is encouraged to begin seeing and thinking in terms of tonal masses immediately. This approach enables students to draw quickly and accurately without the need for a line drawing first. The author compares it to learning to ""paint"" with charcoal.Step-by-step demonstrations and over 200 of the author's own drawings offer inspiration and practical guidance in the technique. You'll learn how to ""see"" tonal quality, how to key a drawing, how to translate color into black and white, and valuable techniques for keeping the figure from looking ""stiff."" Other topics include the role of alignment in achieving proper proportions, foreshortening, male and female figure distinctions, the use of modeling to achieve added dimension, drawing the face, positioning the figure, and many other aspects of life drawing.For students of drawing -- beginner to expert -- this book is an invaluable guide not just to drawing from life but to the essential principles of observation, composition, and draftsmanship that underlie all successful drawing and painting. It belongs in the library of every artist. For this edition, the author has revised previous chapters and added a new one on ""Different Modes of Charcoal."""

9780486274263,"You'll learn everything there is to learn about drawing animals. -- Collectors' CornerThis thoughtful and incisive guidebook, written by a former animator for Walt Disney Studios, will help artists at many skill levels improve their ability to draw a wide variety of animal forms both realistically and as caricatures. You'll learn why the author considers construction, action analysis, and caricature all-important for a clear understanding of animal anatomy and movement. You'll also benefit from Mr. Hultgren's expert advice and tips on catching the essential movement and character of animals and avoiding the stiff, wooden poses that are the frequent and unfortunate result of much sketching of animals from life. Throughout, the emphasis is on construction drawings (there are over 700 line illustrations and halftones) rather than on text. This means the student is able to view the development process of the drawing by example rather than theory or description. The book begins with introductory chapters on the special techniques of drawing animals, the use of line, establishing mood and feeling, conveying action, and brush techniques. Mr. Hultgren then turns to individual animal forms -- horses, deer, cats, cows and bulls, giraffes, camels, gorillas, pigs, and many more. His instruction on animal caricature will be especially valuable to the legions of artists avidly interested in the subject.The Art of Animal Drawing belongs in the library of any artist -- student, amateur, or professional -- who is interested in drawing animals.

9780486267234,"Joseph Sheppard has been favorably compared to practically every Renaissance master...he is without peer among modern realists for his ability to impart a warm verisimilitude to the figure. -- Artspeak magazine.In this highly praised guidebook, Joseph Sheppard, a versatile and influential artist and teacher who is widely recognized as a master of figure drawing, introduces an innovative approach to drawing the human form. Beginning by reviewing the basics of anatomy, he makes his principal focus the specifics of surface anatomy.Rather than depicting in detail the muscles and bone that lie beneath the skin, as do most books on artistic anatomy, this book concentrates on how the position and movement of muscles and bones affect the surface forms of live models. The effects are masterfully demonstrated in over 170 of Joseph Sheppard's own drawings of many different live models in front, back, and side views, and in various standing, sitting, kneeling, crouching, reclining, and twisting poses.Each drawing is accompanied by two diagrams, one for bones, one for muscles, which specifically show how surface forms are created by the definitive shapes beneath the skin. The superb quality of Joseph Sheppard's drawings, the wide range of poses he illustrates, and the effectiveness of his approach in this book -- now in its first paperback edition -- will help artists at all levels improve and refine their skills in drawing the living figure."

Form drawing is an artistic activity using the art of line.

9780945803027,"When students are given fixed and finalized abstractions from the beginning, they do not have to use their own inner forces to overcome the resistance of the world to arrive at truth or to create beauty. The result is that their inner pictures are devoid of life. To arrive at a truth or to create beauty that reflects the order and harmony of the Creator, we must always begin humbly, in ignorance and ugliness. By striving out of ignorance and ugliness toward the true and beautiful, both scientists and artists can bring new, creative forces into the world. Neither memorizing data nor copying a beautiful drawing engages the true imagination of students as it is by drawing a flower from life. It is precisely this lack of an active, striving inner creativity that can result in the frequently overwhelming feelings of anxiety and alienation experienced by so many people today. As a counterbalance, education must--in all areas of knowledge--increasingly focus on the personal creation of what, through its beauty, speaks truth and through its truth radiates beauty. Drawing from the Book of Nature is about both drawing and the natural world of plants and animals. It is a valuable resource for teachers, students, and anyone who wants to develop a capacity for artistic observation of natural phenomena. Dennis Klocek provides a refreshing combination of depth and clarity, offering a wealth of insight into the lives that constitute living nature.

9780486227306,"Can drawing -- sound, honest representation of the world as the eye sees it, not tricks with the pencil or a few effects -- be learned from a book? One of the most gifted draftsmen, who is also one of the greatest art critics and theorists of all time, answers that question with a decided Yes. He is John Ruskin, the author of this book, a classic in art education as well as a highly effective text for the student and amateur today.The work is in three parts, cast in the form of letters to a student, successively covering First Practice, Sketching from Nature, and Colour and Composition. Starting with the bare fundamentals (what kind of drawing pen to buy; shading a square evenly), and using the extremely practical method of exercises which the student performs from the very first, Ruskin instructs, advises, guides, counsels, and anticipates problems with sensitivity. The exercises become more difficult, developing greater and greater skills until Ruskin feels his reader is ready for watercolors and finally composition, which he treats in detail as to the laws of principality, repetition, continuity, curvature, radiation, contrast, interchange, consistency, and harmony. All along the way, Ruskin explains, in plain, clear language, the artistic and craftsmanlike reasons behind his practical advice -- underlying which, of course, is Ruskin's brilliant philosophy of honest, naturally observed art which has so much affected our aesthetic. Three full-page plates and 48 woodcuts and diagrams (the latter from drawings by the author) show the student what the text describes. An appendix devotes many pages to the art works which may be studied with profit. "
9780486227108,"Life Drawing is not so much a unique system of drawing the human form as it is a new way of conceptualizing it. To draw the figure, the artist must ""have an idea of what the figure to be drawn is doing"" -- he must ""sense the nature and condition of the action, or inaction."" In this book, Mr. Bridgman, who for nearly 50 years lectured and taught at the Art Students League of New York, explains in non-technical terms and illustrations in hundreds of finely rendered anatomical drawings how best to find the vitalizing forces in human forms and how best to realize them in drawing.Mr. Bridgman begins by examining movement. After abstracting the main masses of the body -- head, chest, and hips -- into their rough geometrical equivalents, he gives complete instructions for building a simple model which mounts these masses on wire. By manipulating this scale model, the student may observe how these masses move in space and into what relationships such movement brings them.Once the student understands how the human form moves, the author tackles the actual problems of drawing the human figure in motion. He first covers simple drawing and building of the figure, then balance, rhythm, turning or twisting, wedging, passing and locking, and the more complex relationship of the masses -- distribution, light and shade, mouldings (concave and convex), proportion and how to measure it, and movable masses. From here instruction turns to specific areas of the anatomy; the head and features, including the neck; the torso, front and back views; the abdominal arch; the shoulder girdle; the upper limbs, hands, and fingers; and the lower limbs, thigh and leg, knee, and finally foot. Every point of instruction and principle is illustrated in one of nearly 500 of Mr. Bridgman's own ""life"" drawings.There is no student nor serious artist, either amateur or professional, who cannot profit greatly from Bridgman's instruction. Like his famous anatomy course at the Art Students League, it is likely to vitalize your work with the human form."

9780486204260,"This book was written and illustrated by Charles R. Knight (1874-1953), the acknowledged master of animal drawing and the man who American Biographies agrees was generally recognized as the most distinguished painter of animal life. Those who have seen his murals, paintings, and bronzes of both prehistoric and modern animals in the New York Museum of Natural History or any one of a dozen other major zoological museums know why his work is so highly regarded. His animal portrayals are startlingly alive with beauty, virility, charm, power, and expression. He seems to have caught animals in the very act of feeding, stalking, resting, or in any one of the thousands of completely natural attitudes that animals assume. In this book, which is an extensive course in animal drawing, Knight offers an almost incredible wealth of practical instruction to commercial and fine artists, painters, sculptors, book illustrators, designers, decorators, and art students. He discusses animal musculature, bone structure, animal psychology, movements, habits, and habitats. He provides innumerable tips on animal proportions, the play of light and shadow, coloring, hair formation, feather arrangements of birds, scales of fish, how animals lie down, animal expressions, how a lioness bends back her ears when angry, and many others. Scores of animal categories are covered: great apes, tigers, lions, dogs, bears, cattle, horses, antelopes, sheep, goats, camels, swine, seals, rodents, young animals, exotic animals, crocodiles, snakes, fish, and birds. This work should help both practicing artists and art students achieve more natural and lifelike drawings. Especially valuable will be the many pointers on how to avoid stiffness and gracelessness in drawings of horses, deer, and other quick-footed animals; how to introduce the proper sense of bulk and power in sketches of such heavier animals as elephants and bears; and how to put into drawings of the cat family, from the household pet to the African lion, the superb lithe grace and wealth of subtle expression that we marvel at in the originals."

9780385346092,"Drawing activities, art instruction, and advice for artists and non-artists alike. Urban sketching--the process of drawing on the go as a regular practice--is a hot trend in the drawing world. It's also a practical necessity for creatively minded people in a busy world. In this aspirational guide, self-taught French artist France Belleville-Van Stone emboldens readers to craft a ritual of their own and devote more time to art, even if it's just 10 minutes a day. She offers motivation to move beyond the comfort zone, as well as instruction on turning rough sketches into finished work. Belleville Van-Stone learned how to draw through her own daily practice and knows first-hand how hard it is to find time to incorporate creativity into a busy life. She encourages and teaches us how to do it with advice and guidance such as:  - An A-to-Z list of daily sketch prompts, from airports to bananas, faces to hands, meetings and workplaces - Tips on what drawing supplies you can and should have--and how to carry them around - Sections on accepting mistakes, drawing with limited resources, and redefining completion - Plusses and minuses of going digital, including apps, styluses, and brushes For those of us who dream of drawing in the minutes between school and work, bathtime and bedtime, and waking and walking out the door, the practical advice in Sketch  is a revelation. By sharing her own creative process, Belleville-Van Stone Sketch inspires artists both established and aspiring to rethink their daily practice, sketch for the pure joy of it, and document their lives and the world around them."

9782357286696,"The Knights Templars have become associated with legends concerning secrets and mysteries handed down to the select from ancient times. Their financial acumen, their military prowess and their work on behalf of Christianity during the Crusades still circulate throughout modern culture. They were formed in the early 12th century to protect pilgrims to Jerusalem from the Muslims. This large organization of devout Christians during the medieval era served the nations of Europe mightily in the Crusades. Unfortunately, over time they became too rich and powerful and in the mid-14th century, support for the order faded. This book describes the immoral scheme of the French King Philip IV and the Pope Clement V to arrest and try for heresy a lot of the Knights Templars (like James of Molay, the Last Grand Master). But the persecution of the Templars in the fourteenth century does not close the history of the Order; for, though the Knights were spoliated, the Order was not annihilated. James Burnes examines their beginning, their end and their legacy.Edition LARGE PRINT with illustrations and complete footnotes.Excerpt: ""It was in the year 1119, the twentieth of the Christian dominion in Syria, that nine pious and valiant Knights, the greater part of whom had been the companions of Godfrey de Bouillon, formed themselves into an association, the object of which was to protect and defend Pilgrims on their visits to the holy places. These Knights, of whom the two chief were Hugo de Payens and Godfrey de St. Omer, vowed, in honour of the sweet Mother of God, to unite Monkhood and Knighthood; their pious design met with the warm approbation of the King and the Patriarch, and in the hands of the latter they made the three ordinary vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience; and a fourth, of combating without ceasing against the heathen, in defence of Pilgrims and of the Holy Land; and bound themselves to live according to the rule of the canons of St. Augustine, at Jerusalem. The King assigned them for their abode a part of his palace, which stood close by where had stood the Temple of the Lord. He and his barons contributed to their support, and the abbot and canons of the Temple assigned them for the keeping of their arms and magazines the street between it and the royal palace, and hence they took the name of the soldiery of the Temple, or Templars."""

9781446308202,"Rediscover the pleasure you got from childhood drawing, before you became too self-conscious and self-critical to enjoy it.  Most children draw. Before we can write, even, we scribble and sketch and create. But somehow that gets lost as we get older. We learn that Being An Artist is hard and complicated, and that there are technical rules to choosing colour and perfecting your perspective. This book is here to remind you of the joy you once found in creating, scribbling, getting something down on paper - and that it's really about the process and nothing to do with how technically brilliant the finished 'artwork' is.  In this accessible guide, largely self-taught artist Jen Russell-Smith takes beginners by the hand and breaks down the barriers we face around sketching, and shows you how to begin with quick, loose sketches building your confidence and skills to draw spontaneously, with nothing more than the things around you for inspiration.  With simple exercises that anyone can follow, Jen shows you how to sketch the things and the places around you from life, using simple watercolour techniques to add vibrancy to your work. With simple exercises and step-by-step tutorials, Jen shows you how to sketch the places around you from life, and those further afield from photos, using simple watercolour techniques to add vibrancy to your work."

9780813943985,"Accounts of the rise of American literature often start in the 1850s with a cluster of ""great American novels""--Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter,  Melville's Moby-Dick and Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin. But these great works did not spring fully formed from the heads of their creators. All three relied on conventions of short fiction built up during the ""culture of beginnings,"" the three decades following the War of 1812 when public figures glorified the American past and called for a patriotic national literature. Decentering the novel as the favored form of early nineteenth-century national literature, Lydia Fash repositions the sketch and the tale at the center of accounts of American literary history, revealing how cultural forces shaped short fiction that was subsequently mined for these celebrated midcentury novels and for the first novel published by an African American. In the shorter works of writers such as Washington Irving, Catharine Sedgwick, Edgar Allan Poe, and Lydia Maria Child, among others, the aesthetic of brevity enabled the beginning idea of a story to take the outsized importance fitted to the culture of beginnings. Fash argues that these short forms, with their ethnic exclusions and narrative innovations, coached readers on how to think about the United States' past and the nature of narrative time itself. Combining history, print history, and literary criticism, this book treats short fiction as a vital site for debate over what it meant to be American, thereby offering a new account of the birth of a self-consciously national literary tradition.

9780253044167,"In Sketch Comedy: Identity, Reflexivity, and American Television, Nick Marx examines some of the genre's most memorable--and controversial--moments from the early days of television to the contemporary line-up. Through explorations of sketches from well-known shows such as Saturday Night Live, The State, Inside Amy Schumer, Key & Peele, and more, Marx argues that the genre has served as a battleground for the struggle between comedians who are pushing the limits of what is possible on television and network executives who are more mindful of the financial bottom line. Whether creating new catchphrases or transgressing cultural taboos, sketch comedies give voice to marginalized performers and audiences, providing comedians and viewers opportunities to test their own ideas about their place in society, while simultaneously echoing mainstream cultural trends. The result, Marx suggests, is a hilarious and flexible form of identity play unlike anything else in American popular culture and media."

Montague. Each chapter includes a list of recommended readings. These articles supplied what long had been needed for general readers and for law students-a brief but comprehensive, accurate but untechnical account of the origin and growth of English law. ... this series of articles now forms the best available introduction to English legal history. James F. Colby, iii Widely considered the father of legal history, Frederic William Maitland  1850-1906] was an English jurist and historian best known for the standard The History of English Law Before the Time of Edward I, 2 vol. (1895), written with Sir Frederick Pollock. He was educated at Eton and Cambridge and studied at Lincoln's Inn, London. Maitland was called to the bar in 1876, then practiced until 1884 when he became a reader in English law (1884) and professor (1888) at Cambridge. He founded the Selden Society in 1887. Hailed for his original outlook on history, his works profoundly influenced legal scholarship. An extraordinarily productive career was shortened by his death from tuberculosis at age 45. Francis C. Montague  1858-1935] was a Professor of History at University College, London and Lecturer in Modern History, Oriel College, Oxford. He was also the author of The History of England from the Accession of James I. to the Restoration (1907) and The Elements of English Constitutional History from the Earliest Times to the Present Day (1910). James F. Colby  1850-1939] taught international law at Yale Law School from 1883 until 1885. He later taught history and political economics at Dartmouth College, and was Parker Professor of Law and Political Science at Dartmouth College from 1885-1916 and lectured in jurisprudence and international law at Boston University Law School from 1905-1922.

9780486227313,"Second only to Mathew Brady as the foremost early American photographer was Alexander Gardner, the one-time manager of Brady's Washington salon and Brady's chief photographer in the field during the early days of the Civil War. Indeed, Gardner -- who later photographed the War independently -- often managed the famous horse-drawn photographic laboratory and took many of the pictures that used to be attributed to Brady. He accompanied the Union troops on their marches, their camps and bivouacs, their battles, and on their many hasty retreats and routs during the early days of the War. In 1866 Alexander Gardner published a very ambitious two-volume work which contained prints of some 100 photographs which he had taken in the field. A list of them reads like a roster of great events and great men: Antietam Bridge under Travel, President Lincoln (and McClellan) at Antietam, Pinkerton and His Agents in the Field, Ruins of Richmond, Libby Prison, McLean's House Where Lee's Surrender Was Signed, Meade's Headquarters at Gettysburg, Battery D, Second U.S. Artillery in Action at Fredericksburg, the Slaughter Pen at Gettysburg, and many others. This publication is now amoung the rarest American books, and is here for the first time republished inexpensively. Gardner's photographs are among the greatest war pictures ever taken and are also among the most prized records of American history. Gardner was quite conscious of recording history, and spared himself no pains or risk to achieve the finest results. His work indicates a technical mastery that now seems incredible when one bears in mind the vicissitudes of collodion applications in the field, wet plates, long exposures, long drying times, imperfect chemicals -- plus enemy bullets around the photographer's ears. It has been said of these photographs: photography today . . . is far easier, but it is no better. "

It examines how Japanese manga and Asian popular culture have influenced Asian American comics; how these comics and Asian American graphic narratives depict the �look� of race; and how these various representations are interpreted in nations not of their production. By focusing on what graphic narratives mean for audiences in North America and those in Asia, the collection discusses how Western theories about the ways in which graphic narratives might successfully overturn derogatory caricatures are themselves based on contested assumptions; and illustrates that the so-called odorless images featured in Japanese manga might nevertheless elicit interpretations about race in transnational contexts. With contributions from experts based in North America and Asia, Drawing New Color Lines will be of interest to scholars in a variety of disciplines, including Asian American studies, cultural and literary studies, comics and visual studies."

Classic Sketchbook: Botanicals is an art book that shows you how to create flowers that will stand the test of time by taking a close look at the details of great floral paintings, and then coaching you through the techniques.Each spread in this unique book is made up of two hard working components: The left-hand page features a close-up illustration from a noted 19th century and earlier artist, and the right-hand page, made from quality, uncoated stock, is for drawing. There are also coaching tips, observations, and a demonstrative sketch on each page.As you progress through the book, you'll get to try a variety of artists' styles, and see how to apply them to your own personal style. Don't wait to get started! By learning from the masters, you'll become a master yourself."
9781849767194,"A BEAUTIFULLY PRODUCED NEAR-FACSIMILIE OF TURNER'S SKETCHBOOK COLLECTING TURNER'S 'WILSON' STUDIES Turner's sketchbooks were private things which he kept to himself. They might live for some time in his coat pockets or travel bags, to be pulled out as need arose. In the studio, they served as memory banks for future work. Of the nearly three hundred sketchbooks in Turner's house at the time of his death and now in the care of the Clore Gallery, the little book here reproduced is one of the most delightful and fascinating. It marks an important stage in the development of Turner's practice as a draughtsman and was in use when he was only 21 years old. It is a working notebook in which the pressing demands of an increasingly fertile imagination are given expression as it forges a new language for itself: a language that was radically to affect the history of both water-colour and oil painitng in the romantic period and long afterward. Originally marked with 'Copies of Wilson' on the cover, this charming little book is a testimony to the phase of studenthood in Turner's development, Richard Wilson being the supreme exponent of landscape painting in the eighteenth-century in Britain. For Turner, whose lifelong ambition was to show the world that landscape paintings could be a vehicle for the noblest and most ideas, Wilson was, as this book shows, his hero and chief model. This edition of the sketchbook reproduces all these beautiful drawings and watercolours in facsimile, with an illustrated introduction by Turner expert Andrew Wilton discussing their background and impact."

9783037786444,"A fascinating treasury of drawings and plans from one of the 20th century s greatest architects, commented to open unprecedented insight into his design process. The importance of a drawing is immense, because it s the architect s language, said the architect Louis Kahn to his masterclass in 1967. While Kahn s built work has been extensively studied, this publication chooses instead to focus on his drawings as primary sources of insight into his architectural intelligence and imagination. Lavishly illustrated with over 600 high-quality reproductions of work by Kahn and his associates, incisively presented by a group of acclaimed architectural experts, The Importance of a Drawing is a deep immersion into Kahn s work and his design process. A testament to Kahn s masterly craft, this volume also makes a provocative primer on architectural representation by posing timely questions on how architects use drawings to see, learn, conjecture, and reveal. Destined to become a standard reference on Kahn, this book is an essential addition to the libraries of established designers as well as students of architecture. The result of years of extensive research, The Importance of a Drawing contains original contributions and historical texts from Michael Benedikt, Michael B. Cadwell, Louis I. Kahn, Nathaniel Kahn, Sue Ann Kahn, David Leatherbarrow, Michael J. Lewis, Robert McCarter, Michael Merrill, Marshall D. Meyers, Jane Murphy, Harriet Pattison, Gina Pollara, Colin Rowe, David Van Zanten, Richard Wesley, and William Whitaker"

Invitation to Draw offers 99 open-ended drawing prompts, each one proposing a question to investigate that encourages children to free associate and problem solve. The perforated pages make it easy to tear out prompts for on-the-go activities or allowing multiple kids to draw at the same time. A blank cake provides the chance to decorate a dream confection, an empty house inspires stories about who lives there, and a grid of triangles supplies the chance to explore abstract art. What might be hiding in that tree? What sort of robot can you design? The possibilities are endless  Drawing prompts inspire and encourage kids to think and draw differently, and sometimes more creatively, than they might when faced with a blank page. By offering constraints such as a pair of eyes or an empty car and asking a question, children begin thinking about the possibilities and answering the question in their heads even before they put pen (or marker or crayon ) to paper. And through the act of drawing and observing the drawing unfold, the brain continues to think and problem solve, opening up all kinds of creative possibilities around that specific idea."

9781564848895,"Unlock your students' creative potential by exploring the intersections between CS and art across various types of artistic media, including drawing, animation, music and physically interactive art. While there are books that discuss the intersection of the arts and computer science (CS), there are none written for K-12 teachers that cover the content overlaps between CS and the arts beyond a single programming environment, and that feature approaches and examples of practicing artists. Coding and the Arts fills that gap. CS sometimes gets a bad rap as dry, isolated and uninteresting work -- the pursuit of analytically minded techies working alone. In reality, programming is deeply creative and enables artists of all types to discover new ways to express themselves. In this book, you'll explore how to apply computation to stretch the possibilities in many art forms, as well as how to pave the way for entirely new ones. By approaching programming tools as artistic media, you'll connect the dots between programming, creativity and artistic expression. Along the way, you'll learn from a diverse set of computational artists and teachers who are using technology to push the bounds of traditional artistic media. Chapters include: Spotlights of working artists and educators who are integrating computing into their art.Deep dives into artistic programming environments, exploring their unique benefits, constraints and impact on classroom use.Alignment to the four pillars of computational thinking to help you create richer learning experiences for students.Lesson sketches aligned with CS concepts and the ISTE Computational Thinking Competencies.The book also offers strategies for supporting students in developing as computational artists, including the attitudes and practices that will help them as artists and computer scientists. Audience:  K-12 educators"

9781906342357,"This book contains forty-five sermons that Shaikh 'Abd al-Qadir al-Jilani, arguably the greatest Sufi teacher, delivered at his school in Baghdad in the middle of the sixth century Hijra (the twelfth century CE). The Shaikh's words are the fruit of many years of personal strife against his lower self and complete dedication to God. They explain the spiritual journey to attain nearness to God in Islam.In his sermons, Shaikh 'Abd al-Qadir addresses the various spiritual diseases, such as envy, greed, and arrogance. He also teaches about the qualities that the seeker of God must acquire, such as love, renunciation, humility, satisfaction, patience, and truthfulness. He explains to the wayfarers in a simple but powerful and effective way how to have their spiritual diseases healed and what they need for the journey to God. The Master's words and advice are not targeted at certain people but address various spiritual states and stations. His words sate everyone thirsty for practical knowledge that takes them nearer to their Lord.The editor of the Arabic edition of the book, Shaikh Muhammad al-Muhammad al-Kasnazan, did not publish the manuscript in its original form that has the sermons listed chronologically. Rather, he classified the contents of the sermons into forty different subjects, such as ""patience"", ""mercy"", ""love"", etc. This highlights the main themes in Shaikh 'Abd al-Qadir's teachings, which best represent Sufi thought."

9781624650604,"Chris Ayers popped out onto this Planet Earth scene on a sweltering July afternoon in 1975. Shortly thereafter he discovered a groovy magic wand made of wood called a ""pencil."" Through trial and error, and lots of practice, he learned that these nifty little things gave him the means to unlock the worlds of his imagination and give them visual form on paper.  During these early formative years his spongy gray matter soaked up as much as it could about the fascinating world around him, especially in regards to the animal kingdom, dinosaurs, Sesame Street, Star Wars, Disney, art, mythology, monsters in closets, spaceships, Robin Hood, Ray Harryhausen, pirates, extra-terrestrial friends and foes, Jules Verne, Dr. Seuss, Bill Peet, comic book heroes and villains, animation, cartoons...  Fast-forward about twenty years to the spring of 2000. With his Toyota Tercel literally packed to the ceiling, he drove westward from Minneapolis to Los Angeles. He had long dreamt of someday working in the movies and, at age 24, it seemed like the right time in his life to give it a shot.  Fast forward another eight years and he is still driving a Toyota Tercel around the bustling freeways of the City of Angels. His dream of working in the film industry has come true - and then some. Working as a character designer and concept artist he has been involved in some challenging and fun projects such as Men In Black II, Fantastic Four, Incredible Hulk and The Santa Clause 2.  In 2006, on the one-year anniversary of his diagnosis, he started a sketchbook called The Daily Zoo and set out to draw one animal each day for a year. His hope, in addition to being challenging and fun, was that it would help his healing process and give him a focused opportunity to appreciate the gift of each healthy day. "

,柯泯薰 2020 第三張全新創作專輯《畫話 Drawing Dialogue》 12. 11 數位上線 / 12. 29 實體發行 畫出淺藏心底的灰色與斑斕， 對話自我根源的和解與想望 ★ 睽違三年力作，十首逐一描繪、毀壞與重建的生命狀態主題曲。歌者毫不保留透過創作觀看自我，亦藉由他人眼光投射出另一個面向的自己。在自省與觀看、傾訴與聆聽之間對話呼應完成，映照一張誠實勇敢、耐聽流暢的自白專輯。 ★ 攜手日籍音樂人笛岡俊哉、古皓、秦旭章、鍾濰宇、劉哲麟等製作陣容合力打造。李格弟、吳青峰、陳昭淵、秦旭章共同詞曲創作。吳青峰、新加坡音樂人 Koffkoff 跨刀合唱。 ★ 民謠、Band Sound 擅長曲風之外，再展電氣空間的迷離音牆。《畫話》無疑是柯泯薰在製作、詞曲、編曲與聲線的掌握上，拉開更高層次與深度的作品。 ★ 時尚攝影大師周墨掌鏡，金曲裝禎入圍設計師蔡書瑀美學操刀，聯手打造柯泯薰強烈視覺新印象，捕捉多變驚艷的各種樣貌，展現國際大器潮流風範，也勾勒出創作者面向大眾的決心。 「能留下什麼呢？」這是柯泯薰在創造出這張專輯前的第一聲自剖。 歷時三年推出的新專輯《畫話 Drawing Dialogue》，則是柯泯薰對於自己身為「歌手」角色的重新定位，在人聲表現上有更深的挖掘——柯泯薰這次不再隱身於編曲之間歌唱，而是勇敢挺立於音樂之上，拋出可以被細細檢視的聲線；且於收放之間幅度交疊合宜，也刻畫出更動容細膩的情感線條，直揭聽者的內心世界。這張專輯也是現階段的她，正視自己對音樂生涯的懷疑與人生困境後的一個解答，更是她用盡所有力氣，給自己最後一次機會的孤注一擲。柯泯薰不想再慢慢等待他人不經意的停留，而是更坦然自信的降立在眾人目光之中。 柯泯薰不只打破過往的創作慣性，從被動變成主動，集結多位音樂家與詩人助陣，包括吳青峰、秦旭章、陳昭淵共同詞曲創作，並邀請李格弟為旋律填詞，與吳青峰、Koffkoff 合唱；亦透過與 Aknit 笛岡俊哉（夢的雅朵）、古皓、秦旭章（守夜人 Night Keepers）、鍾濰宇、劉哲麟（Little Shy on Allen Street）這些活躍出色的製作人合作，讓整張專輯涵蓋的面向有了更加寬闊和深度的探索，每一個音色也在混音和母帶後期處理的過程中被安放在最適當的位置。整張專輯的製作，除了原先擅長的民謠、搖滾曲風之外，更營造出異次元感官的電氣聲響，替專輯增添豐富的空間影像層次；編曲悠遊於成人流行、慢搖滾、實驗、田野錄音與儀式感，建構出新世代「電氣民謠女巫」之形象。 對聲音極度敏感且注重細節挑惕的柯泯薰，憑前作《DON'T MAKE A SOUND 不能發出聲音》曾入圍第 29 屆金曲獎最佳演唱錄音專輯獎，而在此次的新專輯中，大部分的歌曲更不同於制式在錄音室的配唱規範，她選擇在最熟悉的臥室環境空間裡，透過改造的手作麥克風錄唱，將隱密的心緒傾瀉，更甚而一首歌錄唱百遍以上，只為捕捉最不假思索的真摯呈現，歌聲親密得像在聆聽者耳畔間流連。柯泯薰還親自操刀歌曲人聲處理，更特別邀請 Aknit 笛岡俊哉擔任多首歌曲的混音工程師、共同擔任母帶後期製作人，將專輯中每個聲響妥貼細膩的照顧、精煉處理，使其乾淨明亮並風格集中。 專輯定名為《畫話 Drawing Dialogue》，是柯泯薰在錄製這張專輯前所做的一個試驗。她嘗試將自己聽到的聲音，用畫筆描繪留住，而畫下來的不只是音樂，更是她想說的話。柯泯薰表示：「音樂是有療傷的可能，繪畫、與他人對話亦是，我希望藉由這三種元素，讓每一顆受傷的心能有棲息之地；能用耳朵去感覺自己的存在；用身體去感受心跳的震動；用活著這件事情與自己對話，並且與他人交流，這就是我做這張專輯的初衷。」 專輯開場曲〈飄浮〉是對生活與自我價值的疑問與找尋，接續〈自戀的自虐〉是柯泯薰和自我的相愛相殺，有徬徨自虐也有嘆息渴望，直到與自己和解；流向〈我們之間的河〉講的是人與人的交流，彷彿時間的河，流過生命留下回憶的印痕。而在時間空間被意外限縮的年度裡，〈另個時空的你〉則是柯泯薰想獻給歌迷的暖心禮物；〈Pa-Ting〉用輕快跳躍的節奏，表達對科技與人之間的快速傳遞；〈樹對我說〉則是想送給這世上無分別的愛，邀請大家齊唱這首彩虹之歌。在誠實傾訴故事後的〈拋〉，是歌者想帶領聽眾走出人生困境、奔向自由。迎來遼闊心之所向的〈贈予〉，給所有曾愛得迷失、愛得失語的人們一份溫暖與勇氣。還特別收錄曾獲 2019 亞洲影藝創意大獎（Asian Academy Creative Awards）戲劇類「最佳主題曲」的〈倒轉卡帶〉，更為專輯重新編曲，誕生了心境更顯豁達的版本。 這些歌曲在自我對話之餘，也寫出多數現代人的孤單與憂傷。這是一種雖已安然於此卻仍不知何去何從的憂慮狀態，但柯泯薰的創作能把在當代物質世界無所歸依的心情安放，並能不受干擾地從中得到歸屬。「你的心必須純淨，才能貼近看個仔細。」這是台東池上山丘的〈榕樹爺爺〉告訴她的堅強，作為專輯的收心曲，窺以看見創作者心中綻露的曙光，也是聽者自然嚮往的心中純淨。 柯泯薰願以《畫話 Drawing Dialogue》分享自己生命裡的能量給每位聽眾，像極了一道溫柔療癒的美好魔法，希望讓每位聆聽專輯的人，皆能乘著她的歌聲，畫上專屬於自己靈魂的色彩。 【MV影音】 柯泯薰【拋】MV：https://youtu.be/HRgRMyy_OfE 柯泯薰【另個時空的你】 feat. 吳青峰 MV：https://youtu.be/LBqaZW3bHxA 柯泯薰【自戀的自虐】MV：https://youtu.be/N9VUFPGfHdc

9780814257722,"Eszter Sz p's Comics and the Body is the first book to examine the roles of the body in both drawing and reading comics within a single framework. With an explicit emphasis on the ethical dimensions of bodily vulnerability, Sz p takes her place at the forefront of scholars examining comics as embodied experiences, pushing this line of inquiry into bold new territory. Focusing on graphic autobiography and reportage, she argues that the bodily performances of creators and readers produce a dialogue that requires both parties to experience and engage with vulnerability, thus presenting a crucial opportunity for ethical encounters between artist and reader. Sz p considers visceral representations of bulimia, pregnancy, the effects of STIs, the catastrophic injuries of war, and more in the works of Lynda Barry, Ken Dahl, Katie Green, Miriam Katin, and Joe Sacco. She thus extends comics theory into ethical and psychological territory that finds powerful intersections and resonances with the studies of affect, trauma, gender, and reader response."

9781909741669,"Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) practised as a painter, sculptor, architect, engineer, costume designer, anatomist, botanist, map-maker and much more. The activity that unified these interests was drawing. Leonardo drew to develop his artistic and engineering projects, to record his perceptions of the world around him, to explore his own imagination and to think. The Royal Collection holds by far the most important group of Leonardo's drawings: more than 500 sheets that have been together since the artist's death in 1519 and which are among the most diverse and technically accomplished in the entire history of art. To mark the 500th anniversary of Leonardo's death in 2019, selections of these drawings will be displayed simultaneously at 12 venues across the United Kingdom, followed by major exhibitions at The Queen's Galleries in London and Edinburgh. This publication includes all 200 of the drawings to be shown at each of these venues, and provides an authoritative survey of the richness of Leonardo's drawings in the Royal Collection."

9780764234026,"Many people believe in God and believe that God is everywhere, but they have yet to experience his presence. What did it mean for Moses to encounter God at the burning bush? How did it change his life and his perception of God? What is keeping you from experiencing his presence in your life?It was in that burning bush experience that Moses began to understand and appreciate the sacredness of worship. Through this book, Tozer teaches how proper worship has to be equal to the one we are worshiping, so if we are worshiping God, we must do it on his terms. This means having a spirit of reverence and holiness--like Moses taking off his shoes and kneeling before him. The bush's fire did not frighten Moses, but rather it poured the essence of sacredness into his life, giving him an experience he had never had before. Let this book teach you how, like Moses, to kneel and worship before God's holy fire."

9780295747019,"In the early twentieth century China's most famous commercial artists promoted new cultural and civic values through sketches of idealized modern women in journals, newspapers, and compendia called One Hundred Illustrated Beauties. This genre drew upon a centuries-old tradition of books featuring illustrations of women who embodied virtue, desirability, and Chinese cultural values, and changes in it reveal the foundational value shifts that would bring forth a democratic citizenry in the post-imperial era. The illustrations presented ordinary readers with tantalizing visions of the modern lifestyles that were imagined to accompany Republican China's new civic consciousness.Citizens of Beauty is the first book to explore the One Hundred Illustrated Beauties in order to compare social ideals during China's shift from imperial to Republican times. The book contextualizes the social and political significance of the aestheticized female body in a rapidly changing genre, showing how progressive commercial artists used images of women to promote a vision of Chinese modernity that was democratic, mobile, autonomous, and free from the crippling hierarchies and cultural norms of old China."

Compulsively readable laugh out loud history. --Mary Roach, New York Times bestselling author of Grunt and Stiff In 1958, the U.S. Air Force nuked the moon as a show of military force. In 1967, the CIA sent live cats to spy on the Soviet government. In 1942, the British built a torpedo-proof aircraft carrier out of an iceberg. Of course, none of these things ever actually happened.  But in Nuking the Moon, intelligence historian Vince Houghton proves that abandoned plans can be just as illuminating--and every bit as entertaining--as the ones that made it. Vividly capturing the fascinating stories of how twenty-one plans from WWII and the Cold War went from conception, planning, and testing to cancellation, Houghton explores what happens when innovation meets desperation: For every plan as good as D-Day, there's a scheme to strap bombs to bats or dig a spy tunnel underneath the Soviet embassy. Along the way, he reveals what each one tells us about twentieth-century history, the art of spycraft, military strategy, and famous figures like JFK, Castro, and Churchill. By turns terrifying and hilarious--but always riveting--this is the unique story of history left on the drawing board."

Sculptors, painters, and illustrators pull from the process to sharpen their observations, develop better hand-eye coordination, and improve their understanding and interpretation of what they see. Quick Pose: A Compilation of Gestures and Thoughts on Figure Drawing takes a look at the process, presenting first-rate examples and a brief but well-constructed text highlighted by more than 300 illustrations.  Author Erin Meads defines the quick pose as figure drawings that can be executed in less than 20 minutes. The majority of images in this book took less than five minutes to draw; their brevity encourages more dynamic poses from the model and challenges the artist to make quick decisions about what to include -- and even more significantly, what not to include. Topics include symmetry, foreshortening, light and shadow, drapery, and other essential elements of figure drawing. Artists, art students, art teachers, and anyone who draws will appreciate these well-illustrated insights."

During Therese Barleta's childhood years, her mother always gave her a pencil and a stack of papers to draw on, which she would doodle various images on. As the doodles developed into recognizable drawings of animals and people, her family discovered that she had a knack for drawing and they encouraged her to keep practicing this skill. Comic books, such as Archie, Marvel, and, eventually, Manga, nurtured her love for drawing and then later developed her skill for drawing realistically when Interactive Arts Services employed her as a storyboard penciller.HowExpert publishes quick 'how to' guides on all topics from A to Z by everyday experts."
9781855147973,"David Hockney is recognised as one of the master draughtsmen of our times and a champion of the medium. This book will feature Hockney’s work from the 1950s to now and focus on his depictions of himself and a smaller group of sitters close to him: his muse, Celia Birtwell; his mother, Laura Hockney; and his friends, the curator, Gregory Evans, and master printer, Maurice Payne. This book will examine not only how drawing is fundamental to Hockney’s distinctive way of observing the world around him, but also how it has been a testing ground for ideas and modes of expression later played out in his paintings. From Old Masters to modern masters, from Holbein to Picasso, Hockney’s portrait drawings reveal his admiration for his artistic predecessors and his continuous stylistic experimentation throughout his career. Alongside an in-depth essay from the curator, this book will feature an exclusive interview between author and curator, Sarah Howgate, and artist, David Hockney. In addition, an ‘In Focus’ essay by British Museum curator Isabel Seligman, will explore the relationship between Hockney, Ingres and Picasso drawings."

9784900212411,"Rarely speaking of his own work, Heinz Bienefeld distanced himself from the star architect role. Instead, he chose modestly scaled residential and religious projects that were built to last multiple generations of users His work in brick and steel was influenced by classical architecture, particularly the Greeks, Romans, and Renaissance. He achieved these designs by steadily working through different scale drawings from 1:500 to his favored 1:10 which would sometimes be colored and resemble paintings These built works would exceed client expectations by striving to be enduringly beautiful As architecture increasingly became digitized, Heinz Bienefeld (1926-1995) remained analog. Guest editor Wilfried Wang, presents original drawings from 5 projects and conversations visiting them with Bienefeld's son Nikolaus. Bienefeld was known to design through a series of drawing scales, starting small and conceptual, then getting client approval at a medium level. Finally, details would be worked out in charcoal at his favorite scale of 1:10, then transferred by pencil and ink. Some of the drawings would be painted, giving the impression of paintings. These designs were frequently discussed with the craftsmen who would work on the project. Their input led to the construction of special, customized details unique to the structure. He favored building methods that proved long lasting, delivering projects that would serve multiple generations of users. Text in English and Japanese."

9789063695330,"A must have for product design students  Are designers still making drawings by hand? Isn't it more advanced to use a computer in this computer era? Some may think sketching is a disappearing skill, but if you ever enter a design studio, you will find out differently. Studios still make sketches and drawings by hand and in most cases, quite a lot of them. They are an integral part of the decision-making process, used in the early stages of design, in brainstorming sessions, in the phase of research and concept exploration, and in presentation. Drawing has proved to be, next to verbal explanation, a powerful tool for communicating not only with fellow designers, engineers or model makers but also with clients, contractors and public offices. This book can be regarded as a standard book on design sketching, useful for students in product design."

9788416851843,"This original work introduces readers to the drawing and painting techniques in the hyperrealist movement, a style applied to painting whose techniques aspire to photographic exactitude in drawing. From the first action before viewing the piece--the search for information and reference images--to different drawing and sculpture techniques, the book offers a step-by-step explanation of the creative process and shows readers how to illustrate in black and white and with colored pencils, how to work with watercolors and oil, how to create a trompe l'oeil and how to create a realistic looking 3D model. Readers will find all the techniques and suggestions they need to make their own hyperrealist creations, all explained in a pleasant and fun way. It is an original and creative way to introduce different drawing techniques that will awaken the artist inside of us all and whose results will strike most readers as surprising given the degree of realism achieved, as if they were photographs. The book includes references to contemporary artists who have used each of the techniques described, curiosities in the world of art and other tricks of the trade."

9781623172763,"A body-focused, trauma-informed art therapy that will appeal to art therapists, somatic experiencing practitioners, bodyworkers, artists, and mental health professionals While art therapy traditionally focuses on therapeutic image-making and the cognitive or symbolic interpretation of these creations, Cornelia Elbrecht instructs readers how to facilitate the body-focused approach of guided drawing. Clients draw with both hands and eyes closed as they focus on their felt sense. Physical pain, tension, and emotions are expressed without words through bilateral scribbles. Clients then, with an almost massage-like approach, find movements that soothe their pain, discharge inner tension and emotions, and repair boundary breaches. Archetypal shapes allow therapists to safely structure the experience in a nonverbal way. Sensorimotor art therapy is a unique and self-empowering application of somatic experiencing--it is both body-focused and trauma-informed in approach--and assists clients who have experienced complex traumatic events to actively respond to overwhelming experiences until they feel less helpless and overwhelmed and are then able to repair their memories of the past. Elbrecht provides readers with the context of body-focused, trauma-informed art therapy and walks them through the thinking behind and process of guided drawing--including 100 full-color images from client sessions that serve as helpful examples of the work."

However, this book provides genuinely new perspectives on the Concorde program as it explores how this great aircraft came into being, concentrating both on the design and development aspects of the airliner and on the political background to this exercise in Anglo-French collaboration. Early chapters look at the various supersonic transport proposals mooted both in Britain and France before Concorde. The following sections examine areas relating to the practical difficulties of supersonic flight such as supersonic booms. The narrative then moves on to how the British and French work was merged into a single program. Later portions of the book describe the flight test program leading up to service entry in 1976 and the text is complimented by an extensive range of photographs and drawings, a great many of which are previously unpublished."

Many projects include varying examples and executions of the activity to illustrate and reinforce the open-ended nature of the labs, inspiring children to embrace and share their own voice.

9780500343418,"Illustrated by the architect and in his own words, this memoir features drawings never seen outside Santiago Calatrava’s studio. Santiago Calatrava is an intimate insight into one of the world’s most celebrated―and controversial―architects. Calatrava first made a name for himself in the late 1980s, with delicately designed structures in Zu¨rich that seem to grow out of the earth. He went on to create a series of highly innovative, iconic bridges across Europe and, in recent years, has drawn attention for such large-scale projects as the City of Arts and Sciences in his birth town of Valencia, Spain, and the World Transportation Hub at Ground Zero in New York.Written in the first person and accompanied by a wealth of sketches never seen outside Calatrava’s studio, this book reveals the breadth of his influences, and how they have combined with his background in engineering and architecture to inspire his signature buildings.

9783836567190,"Drawing with ScissorsMatisse’s revolutionary late-period workToward the end of his monumental career as a painter, sculptor, and lithographer, an elderly, sickly Matisse was unable to stand and use a paintbrush for long. In this late phase of his life―he was almost 80 years of age―he developed the technique of “carving into color,” creating bright, bold paper cut-outs. Though dismissed by some contemporary critics as the folly of a senile old man, these gouaches decoupées (gouache cut-outs) in fact represented a revolution in modern art, a whole new medium that reimagined the age-old conflict between color and line.This fresh edition of the first volume of our original award-winning XXL book provides a thorough historical context to Matisse’s cut-outs, tracing their roots in his 1930 trip to Tahiti, through to his final years in Nice. It includes many photos of Matisse, some rare images, by Henri Cartier-Bresson and the filmmaker F. W. Murnau and text from Matisse, publisher E. Tériade, the poets Louis Aragon, Henri Michaux, and Pierre Reverdy, and Matisse’s son-in-law Georges Duthuit.In their deceptive simplicity, the cut-outs achieved both a sculptural quality and an early minimalist abstraction which would profoundly influence generations of artists to come. Exuberant, multi-hued, and often grand in scale, these works are true pillars of 20th-century art, and as bold and innovative to behold today as they were in Matisse’s lifetime"

Examples from art history and contemporary masters supplement these lessons. The end result is a drawing instruction book that provides artists with everything they need to render landscapes no matter their skill level."

9781580935050,"Everyday Sketching and Drawing offers an easy-to follow, 5-step formula, which teaches beginner-friendly techniques for learning the skills necessary to make drawing and sketching an everyday habit. For those who have always wanted to or tried and failed to learn to draw it provides simple step-by-step instruction, plus easy-to-follow practice exercises, and provides the motivation and inspiration readers need to be successful. For those who already draw, Everyday Sketching and Drawing offers another technique to add to their drawing arsenal.Why do so many adults come to view drawing as difficult or fraught with anxiety? Traditional art instruction is often bogged down with jargon, rules, and admonishments that unintentionally stifle the joy of drawing for its own sake.Steven Reddy's new and easy approach to drawing instructs sketchers to document their unique and compelling lives in realistic yet playful sketches that record the places, spaces, and objects that help define them as individuals. He reminds artists to slow down, notice, and attend to the sketch-worthy scenes and subjects that are unstaged and always there in our everyday lives. He offers a versatile technique that can lead to a skill that fills sketchbooks with the visual details that differentiate one life from another. This approach is a meditative, relaxing alternative to academic concerns about perspective, proportion, and accuracy. Reddy encourages artists to capture in whimsical but detail-specific illustrations their unique, subjective interpretation of their visual surroundings.Steven Reddy's drawing method produces extremely detailed and realistic scenes of objects and scenes in everyday life in a relatively short period of time (60 minutes to 3 hours or more, depending on the sketcher's preference). Modifying a technique utilized by Old Master oil painters, the drawings pass through 5 clearly articulated stages where each step focuses on one visual concept at a time."

Carolyn Yerkes answers that question in a fresh investigation into the status of architectural drawing in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Her book explores a vast network of manuscripts and drawings that each have information about ancient and modern buildings—including the Pantheon and Saint Peter’s—that is not known from any other sources. The drawings also show how the information was recorded, transferred, and analyzed by others. Yerkes examines the nature of architectural evidence to understand how Renaissance architects used images to explore structures, create biographies, and write history."

9781580934527,"An Authoritative, Comprehensive Guide for Contemporary Figurative Artists At a time when renewed interest in figurative art is surging throughout the art world, author Robert Zeller presents The Figurative Artist's Handbook--the first comprehensive guide to figure drawing and painting to appear in decades.  Illustrated with Zeller's own exquisite drawings and paintings as well as works by nearly 100 historical and contemporary figurative art masters, the handbook is also a treasure trove of the finest figurative art of the past and the present day. Included are Michelangelo, Pieter Brueghel the Elder, Peter Paul Rubens, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Gustav Klimt, Edward Hopper, Andrew Loomis, Andrew Wyeth, Lucian Freud, Odd Nerdrum, Eric Fischl, Bo Bartlett, Steven Assael, John Currin, and many others. Original and thoroughly modern in his approach, Zeller brings together three figure-drawing methods long thought to be at odds, synthesizing these seemingly incompatible techniques to achieve a cohesive and complete understanding of the human figure. Although all three methods underlie contemporary fine-arts practice and education, no artist's handbook has ever combined them before:  The Study of Gesture (Disegno): Rooted in the Italian Mannerist style of the 16th and 17th centuries, the gestural method emphasizes life, rhythm, and movement in the human body.   The Structural Approach: A mainstay of 20th- and 21st-century art instruction, this method applies an architectural perspective to the body, using a block conception for anatomically sound, solid figures.  The Atelier Method: Based on the training provided by 18th- and 19th-century art academies, the atelier approach creates sensual, smooth renderings based on meticulous study of the figure's surface morphology in light and shadow.  Covering all the basics as well as many advanced techniques, The Figurative Artist's Handbook is aimed at both students and experienced artists. A practical, how-to guide, it provides in-depth step-by-step instruction and--rare among figure-drawing books--features sections on composition, portraiture, and painting. Chapters on creativity and on using a sketchbook help readers hone their artistic vision and evolve ideas from the initial inspiration to the fully developed work. Also included is an extensive section highlighting the great movements in figurative art throughout history--from ancient Egypt and Greece to the present."

Being active in visual arts from an early age, he started with colored drawings using oil pastels until they failed to make the kind of artwork he wanted. From colors he shifted to black and white drawings. He first attempted to adopt the techniques he managed to learn from his experiences to ink drawing. Ink drawing still failed to meet his expectations. It was not until he tried using charcoals that he was satisfied. From then on he has used charcoal as his primary tool to produce a fine piece of art. HowExpert publishes quick 'how to' guides on all topics from A to Z by everyday experts."

GEORGE'S HOSPITAL MEDICAL SCHOOL, LONDON REVISED & RE-EDITED -RE-ILLUSTRATED ""1918"" TWENTIETH EDITION Gray's Anatomy is an English-language textbook of human anatomy originally written by Henry Gray and illustrated by Henry Vandyke Carter that may be most readable and popular anatomy book in the World literature. Earlier editions were called Anatomy: Descriptive and Surgical and Gray's Anatomy: Descriptive and Applied, but the book's original name is commonly shortened to, and later editions are titled, Gray's Anatomy. The book is widely regarded as an extremely influential work on the subject, and has continued to be revised and republished from its initial publication in 1858 to the present day. The latest edition of the book, the 41st, was published in September 2015. Last's textbook, 'Anatomy Regional and Applied', was first published in 1954 and heralded a new generation of anatomy texts providing a more concise option to 'Gray's Anatomy' or Cunningham's 'Textbook of Anatomy'. Origins of the Book's History: The English anatomist Henry Gray was born in 1827. He studied the development of the endocrine glands and spleen and in 1853 was appointed Lecturer on Anatomy at St George's Hospital Medical School in London. In 1855, he approached his colleague Henry Vandyke Carter with his idea to produce an inexpensive and accessible anatomy textbook for medical students. Dissecting unclaimed bodies from workhouse and hospital mortuaries through the Anatomy Act of 1832, the two worked for 18 months on what would form the basis of the book. Their work was first published in 1858 by John William Parker in London. It was dedicated by Gray to Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie, 1st Baronet. An imprint of this English first edition was published in the United States in 1859, with slight alterations. Gray prepared a second, revised edition, which was published in the United Kingdom in 1860, also by J.W. Parker. However, Gray died the following year, at the age of 34, having contracted smallpox while treating his nephew (who survived). His death had come just three years after the initial publication of his Anatomy Descriptive and Surgical. SINCE the publication of the first English edition of this work in 1858 and the first American edition in 1859 great advances in the subject of Anatomy have been made, especially in microscopic anatomy and the anatomy of the embrio. This knowledge was embodied from time to time in the successive editions until finally considerable portions of the text, sometimes sections, were devoted to these subjects. However, the main text has always remained primarily a descriptive anatomy of the human body. In the present edition the special sections on embryology and histology have been distributed among the subjects under which they naturally belong. New matter on physiological anatomy, laws of bone architecture, the mechanics and variations of muscles have been added, occupying much of the space formerly devoted to the sections in applied anatomy. The sections on the ductless glands and the nervous system have been largely rewritten. In the latter a more rational presentation of the sympathetic nervous system has been achieved through the use of diagrams and descriptions based on physiological and pharmacological work. The central connections of the spinal and cranial nerves are also emphasized. Illustrations have been added wherever important points could be made more clear, and throughout the work colored pictures have been even more extensively used than heretofore. In this respect special mention might be made of the central nervous system and the section on the muscles.  EDITOR]"

9781936863853,"Written to fill an existing gap in the current available knowledge on trance, prophesy, deity-possession, and mediumship within the neo-Pagan and Wiccan communities, Lifting the Veil was developed from Janet Farrar and Gavin Bone's personal work and public workshops on trance-prophesy and ecstatic ritual over the last 20 years. The book covers the history and modern practice of trance as well as the methods of practice, including ecstatic ritual, drawing down the moon, sex magic, and working with the spirits of the dead. It also explores the Four Keys, which include the importance of understanding mythical cosmology and psychology, understanding the role of energy in trance, the nature of spirits and deity, and understanding what trance is and the techniques involved. Because trance-prophesy is a very subjective process, the book includes descriptions of the personal experiences of others and transcriptions from several independent sessions by modern seers and priestesses."

Sadly many take hands for granted both in having them and in drawing them, many starting artists think they are easy and something they will land the very first time, but unfortunately very few, if any, are an art genius from the start. I have seen many starting artist hide the hands of the person in their art piece, behind the back, in their pants pockets, etc. If you think about it you may have played this trick before as well, probably one of the reasons you need this book. But do not worry or fret it might take a little bit of time topped with some good old practice to draw this vital part of the human body. Hands can be difficult because they can assume hundreds of different shapes and positions with a very complex muscular and skeletal structure in them. Not to mention the angle at which they are viewed will change the whole process of drawing them. In this book we are going to talk about how to draw hands. We're going to see how to capture the complexities of the hand and draw them on paper, a canvas, or anything you can possibly imagine, you're the artist after all"

Written in a friendly style, the book is illustrated with hundreds of life drawing studies (both quick poses and long studies), along with charts and diagrams showing the various anatomical and structural components. This comprehensive manual features 5 distinct sections, each focusing on a different aspect of the human figure: bones and joint movement, muscle groups, surface form and soft tissue characteristics, structure, and movement.

To many people, the process of drawing seems mysterious and somehow beyond human understanding. This is a terrible and needless situation. This is like saying that before the Industrial Revolution, most people could not read or write, and so no one can ever learn to do so. Anyone who can hold a pencil and write legibly can learn to draw well, whether they are four years old or eighty years old. You just have to teach your brain how to move a pencil in the correct direction. This book will get you started. Don't think you can't do the exercises in this book because ""you can't draw""  That's like not learning the alphabet because you can't read, or not learning to count because you can't do math  DRAWING COMES BEFORE ART Most people think that drawing is art, but drawing is not art, although drawing does come before art, just as counting comes before math, and the alphabet comes before reading. BENEFITS TO DRAWING INCLUDE: - Increase the ability of your right brain, so you become whole- brained. - Increase the ability to perceive and solve problems with new solutions. - Have another means of communication through visual methods. - Gain self-confidence because you know you can draw. - Have a natural way to totally relax and feel blissfully happy. DRAWING GIVES YOU A FULL BRAIN Learning to draw is important for everyone to do, not just children, because drawing exercises the right brain. Unfortunately, nearly everything you learned at school exercised only the left brain, which means that most schooling is a half-brained affair. THE ONLY FOUR STEPS TO ART: 1) Line Drawing. This book will teach you that. 2) Shading. 3) Color. 4) Painting. MOST 'LEARN TO DRAW' BOOKS ARE USELESS I remember when I was a child and wanted to learn to draw, and got a bunch of those ""Learn to draw..."" books. They were all worse than useless. I threw them out. Nearly all of them make you see a horse as a bunch of circles and oval sausages and squares somehow tied together. Then you fill in the 'missing' areas. Then you have to erase the parts of the circle that were never there in the first place. Then somehow redraw the areas that were not really circles to begin with. That's ridiculous  What they are trying to do is get you to see things that just aren't there. There is no part of a horse that is a perfect circle. And if there was, what happens when the animal turns a bit? It was not until I found some learn-to-draw-with-grid books that I finally learned to draw. LEONARDO DA VINCI USED GRIDS The aim of this book is to teach you how to draw accurate, realistic line drawings. Most interestingly, if you have ever wondered how the early art masters created such realistic paintings, many of which look almost like photographs, one of their secrets was that many of them used grids.

Yet in the contemporary art world drawing is increasingly regarded as a medium in its own right, and the figure as a subject for ongoing exploration well beyond the sketchbook. Drawing People is a thoughtful and beautifully illustrated survey of the most compelling and inventive drawings of the human form being produced today by 70 contemporary artists from around the world. An introduction places the medium of drawing in its historical context, discussing its intersection with photography, painting, collage and illustration, as well as its ability to intimately express thought, personality and emotion. Five chapters-Body, Self, Personal Lives, Social Reality and Fictions-include short introductions outlining each theme, followed by generously illustrated profiles on individual artists exploring their style, approach to the medium and the ideas, narratives and inspirations that lie behind their mark-making. A selection of finely reproduced images highlights the latest work by each artist. Drawing People features an international roster of artists working with pencil, ink, watercolor, charcoal and crayon, including Francis Alÿs, Charles Avery, Louise Bourgeois, Francesco Clemente, Adam Dant, Marlene Dumas, Dr. Lakra, Paul McCarthy, Nalini Malani, Wangechi Mutu, Raymond Pettibon, Rosemarie Trockel, Tal R, Marcel Dzama, Barry McGee, Amy Sillman and Kara Walker.

9783037782217,"Like few others, Louis Kahn cultivated the craft of drawing as a means to architecture. His personal design drawings - seen either as a method of discovery or for themselves - are unique in the twentieth century. Over two hundred - mostly unpublished - drawings by Kahn and his associates are woven together with a lively and informed commentary into an intimate biography of an architectural idea. Unfolding around the iconic project for the Dominican Motherhouse (1965 - 69) the drawings form a narrative which not only reveals the richness and hidden dimensions of this unbuilt masterpiece, but provides compelling insights into Louis Kahn's mature culture of designing. Kahn - long considered an 'architects' architect' - emerges as a vivid and instructive guide, provoking reflection on questions which continue to remain relevant: on how works are conceived, on how they might be perceived, on how they become part of human experience. Fascinating not only in their beauty, the drawings open a new and stimulating perspective on one of the past century's great architects."

Scrutinizing a wide range of drawings, Petherbridge confirms a long historical commitment to the primal importance of sketching in generating ideas and problem solving, examines the production of autonomous drawings as gifts or for pleasure, and traces the importance of the life-class and theories of drawing in the training of artists until well into the 20th century. She also addresses the changing role of drawing in relation to contemporary practice and its importance for conceptual artists working in a nonhierarchical manner with a multiplicity of practices, techniques and technologies.  In addition to analyzing specific works by Leonardo, Michelangelo, Rembrandt, Goya, Picasso, and other great draftsmen, Petherbridge pays close attention to those artists traditionally regarded as �minor� because of their graphic elaboration or involvement with caricature and play, as well as to the important contribution of women artists in the 20th and 21st centuries. Responding to the vibrant rediscovery of drawing as significant practice in studios, exhibitions, and art schools, Petherbridge proposes an ambitious and novel agenda for the study and enjoyment of drawing."

The electronic creation and production of images in all the design professions has led today to fundamental changes in the design processes. Hence, drawing has gained a new importance. Designing by drawing mobilises the eye, the head and the hand to an equal degree, and it establishes connections among the senses that the designer can only experience in a very limited way on the computer screen.The subject of this book is drawing as the catalyst of design processes, emphasizing the importance of drawing as a design tool by presenting a multitude of drawing techniques with concise instructions with proven methods from the Basel School of Design."

9780262512930,"Drawings, doodles, and ideograms argue with ferocity and wit for traditional urbanism and architecture.Architect L�on Krier's doodles, drawings, and ideograms make arguments in images, without the circumlocutions of prose. Drawn with wit and grace, these clever sketches do not try to please or flatter the architectural establishment. Rather, they make an impassioned argument against what Krier sees as the unquestioned doctrines and unacknowledged absurdities of contemporary architecture. Thus he shows us a building bearing a suspicious resemblance to Norman Foster's famous London �gherkin� as an example of �priapus hubris� (threatened by detumescence and �priapus nemesis�); he charts �Random Uniformity� (�fake simplicity�) and �Uniform Randomness� (�fake complexity�); he draws bloated �bulimic� and disproportionately scrawny �anorexic� columns flanking a graceful �classical� one; and he compares �private virtue� (modernist architects' homes and offices) to �public vice� (modernist architects' �creations�). Krier wants these witty images to be tools for re-founding traditional urbanism and architecture. He argues for mixed-use cities, of �architectural speech� rather than �architectural stutter,� and pointedly plots the man-vehicle-landneed ratio of �sub-urban man� versus that of a city dweller. In an age of energy crisis, he writes (and his drawings show), we �build in the wrong places, in the wrong patterns, materials, densities, and heights, and for the wrong number of dwellers�; a return to traditional architectures and building and settlement techniques can be the means of ecological reconstruction. Each of Krier's provocative and entertaining images is worth more than a thousand words of theoretical abstraction.Drawings, doodles, and ideograms argue with ferocity and wit for traditional urbanism and architecture."

""As an art student,"" Professor Mantle recalls, ""I was frequently frustrated by instructional books that gave lengthy verbal descriptions of visual concepts and then showed small and/or unclear diagrams of those concepts. As an art teacher, I found that my students would gain a clearer understanding of a visual concept if my verbal explanation was combined with a diagram of that concept.""A Visual Guide to Classical Art Theory is great for both traditional and non-traditional media.

9780810123571,"Chicago-born architect Marion Mahony Griffin (1871-1961) is known primarily for a magnificent drafting style that incorporated architectural plans into dramatic and stylized landscapes. Yet standard histories of early twentieth-century architecture have not fully recognized her pioneering work, which went far beyond her early contributions to the Prairie School. Marion Mahony Griffin: Drawing the Form of Nature is the first book devoted to Mahony Griffin's graphic work and presents a new critical interpretation of her art. Marion Mahony Griffin was the second woman to graduate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a degree in architecture and the first woman licensed to practice architecture in Illinois. After years of freelance drafting and design--most famously for Frank Lloyd Wright--she and her husband, architect Walter Burley Griffin, embarked on a career that catapulted them from Chicago to Australia in 1914 after winning the international competition to design the Federal Capital of Australia at Canberra. Marion Mahony Griffin's graphic art is defined by her innovative representations of nature. Her presentation drawings clearly illustrate that architectural design and forms of the natural landscape are inseparable. Botanical forms are also woven into her children's book illustrations and murals and are the subject of the series of Forest Portraits she made in Australia. The many illustrations in this book include vintage photographs of Mahony Griffin's life and work and commercial illustrations that have previously never been published, new photographs of her public murals, full-page color plates of her architectural renderings and Forest Portraits, as well as an exclusive color facsimile of the Forest Portraits and captions as found in the New-York Historical Society's copy of Marion Mahony Griffin's unpublished memoir The Magic of America."

You are important. Come join the journey. You are wanted and needed far more than you can even imagine."" From the Foreword by M. Scott Peck, M.D. Author: The Road Less Traveled ""This book is like having a compassionate friend who is totally devoted to helping you become who and what you really can be. A marvelous mix of transformational strategies and healing myths, it serves as a gentle but powerful guide to living the larger story.""

Stanley Krippner Professor of Psychology, Saybrook Institute Co-author: The Mythic Path Every day, life is challenging. Discovering what you truly want, how to go after it, how to form deep relationships-these are on-going questions that, in happy or in sad times, may call to you, trip you up or even completely block your path to success. But instead of being frustrated by such challenges, you can learn to see them as the very heart of life and meet them with zest. In this unique book packed with guidance, wisdom and empowering activities, the authors present a new way to accomplish all your important tasks: to become an everyday hero, someone who, like the great figures of ancient myths, learns through life's varied adventures to think creatively, choose wisely, and trust your inner resources. Become an everyday hero and make lives around you, and the world, better for your presence. The Path of the Everyday Hero taps into what Joseph Campbell, Robert Bly, Sam Keen, Jean Houston, and others have identified as the instructive power of myth. Here, the authors connect five classic stories to five of life's most important challenges. By reading and contemplating these stories, you can glean fresh insights for your own journey. In Perceval and the Holy Grail, you will learn how to live to fulfill your true purpose. In Beauty and the Beast, you will see how to create relationships that work for you and all. In The Peasant Who Married a Goddess, you will discover how to use your inner resources to turn the pressures and stresses of life into breakthroughs. In Theseus and the Minotaur, you will find a way to turn the competing demands of your personal and professional lives into a beneficial synergy. In Cinderella, you will explore values beyond material wealth to enrich your life. In the final chapter you will create your own personal myth as a metaphorical blueprint for transforming your life. Each chapter provides a variety of approaches to awaken your creative spirit and bring your life into alignment with your highest vision. When you translate each of your challenges into a story of the Hero's Journey, you experience a new awareness about the meaning of the challenge and your ability to resolve it. Wherever you may be in life right now and whatever challenges lie in front of you, The Path of the Everyday Hero will help you see your journey in a heroic perspective, and live every day with greater joy, strength, and fulfillment. Note: The Path of the Everyday Hero is a valuable handbook of ideas and activities for educators, counselors, consultants and anyone facilitating people's transformation beyond their challenges and into being more successful than they dreamed they could possibly be."

9780486435404,"Artists of classical Greece and the Renaissance were highly aware of the complexity and great beauty of the human figure, and strove in their artwork to depict the ideal form. This book by an experienced twentieth-century art teacher covers two fundamentals of figure drawing that were equally important to masters of earlier eras -- anatomy and perspective, subjects that seldom receive a thorough treatment within the same book. Carefully addressing both topics, the text suggests ways to convey the structure and functions of the human figure, covers elementary principles of drawing, and considers the use of light and shadow. Also discussed are aspects of measurement and the application of such simple forms as the cube, cylinder, and sphere in representing parts of the human body.In describing the relationship between anatomical features and surface form, the chapters on anatomy include drawings of the bones and muscles of the trunk, upper and lower limbs, and the head and its prominent aspects. A final section focuses on accessories, such as eyeglasses and clothing -- items which, when worn, virtually become part of the figure's anatomy.Clearly and concisely written, Anatomy and Perspective will be an important addition to the personal library of anyone interested in drawing the human figure.

9783836566988,"""Silly Fool Comics"" fills the final page in this final volume, with a devilish creature telling the anguished Crumb, ""YOU Will Soon Be DEAD!"" He was a mere 67, but in his self-absorbed Crumbish way was obsessing about death, when not making intimate and loving portraits of his wife Aline and all the other women who'd tormented his libido since boyhood. Most impressive in this book are his historic tableau, some single page, others multi-page strips, including Piers the Ploughman of 14th century England, My Secret Life by ""Walter,"" Rough Women of the Dark Ages and The Apache Dance, from a 1930s Parisian postcard. His Rapidographed cross hatching is superb as ever and we are treated to long screeds displaying his undimmed brilliance at analyzing the human condition, in a morbid but nonetheless amusing way.One could say there are no surprises in content, as Crumb has produced a consistent body of work over the last 40, if not 50, years, yet each page is also jarringly different from the one before, due to his personal juxtaposition of images. So much is packed in you can spend an hour and find you're only a quarter of the way through, with Crumb bemoaning his mortality, while continuing to prosper, every few pages. A fine stand-alone volume, and must-have completion for the sketchbook set."

9783631851395,"The book covers a very special moment in the life of Piotr Michalowski (1800-55), the most outstanding painter of Polish Romanticism. In his early life, Michalowski built a career as a technocrat and later became head of the state-owned heavy industry. At the time, he proved himself a brilliant amateur salon painter. During the anti-Russian uprising of 1830-31, he was responsible for producing weapons for the Polish army, and would later head for France to pursue the arts. This change in his mindset is documented by the sketchbook he kept in January 1832. It illustrates the transition from a superficial salon artist to keen student of nature and insightful realist. The authors analyze the sketchbook, the circumstances of its creation, and its deeper structure from several perspectives."

9783753497266,"First of all, physics and magic are two completely different worldviews: - Physics looks at evolution along the time-ray and finds quantitative correlations - magic looks at simultaneities and finds qualitative correlations. - Physics considers quantity-equalities and finds formulas by it - magic considers quality-equalities and finds analogies by it. - Physics considers the multiplicity of the world and finds the perfect determinacy of all outer events - magic considers the unity of consciousness and finds therefore the freedom of all inner actions. You cannot explain one worldview with the other, but you can combine the two into a more comprehensive worldview. If one compares the structures in both worldviews, one finds a very broad correspondence: - Both the angles in physics and the angles in astrology have the same qualities. - Both the superstring and the zodiac are a twelve-divided circle. - Both the superstring theory and the Kabbalistic Tree of Life have eleven areas with the same quality. - Both the solar circumference and the chakra system have the same structure. From these and some other building blocks the detailed sketch of a unified magical-physical world view can be put together."

9781632933225,"In 1920, my mother and my aunt, who were just thirteen and fourteen years old, went on an all-summer odyssey with a group of artists, led by their art teacher, renowned Texas artist Frank Reaugh, traveling in a vehicle called the ""Cicada,"" from Dallas, Texas, to the Grand Canyon, which had been designated a National Park in November 1919. My aunt's lively diary of the trip is the basis for my account, which has been expanded into a longer narrative. The title Seeing the Elephant was chosen because the travelers' experiences fit the old story of ""seeing the elephant."" They had car engine problems, had flat tires, got stuck in mud, ran out of money, and were visited by tarantulas-but none of it mattered because of the thrilling wonders of the trip, the breathtaking scenery and the opportunity to try to capture it on paper. Toward the end of my writing process on this manuscript, I reflected on the two-month odyssey of the Cicada in 1920 and realized that it was a metaphor for life itself-the joys, challenges, sorrows, and people met along the journey-embraced by an overriding beauty. The story is told in first person, from my aunt's point of view."

9781476671499,"In the early days of television, comedy often meant stale vaudeville routines and stand-up. Then, in 1950, a new comedy-variety show debuted on NBC--Your Show of Shows. Its gifted and mercurial star, Sid Caesar, talented ensemble cast and superb writing staff--including Mel Brooks, Neil Simon, Lucille Kallen and Mel Tolkin--would create comedy designed for the new medium and provide a template for successful shows that followed. With rare illustrations and the most complete sketch guide yet compiled, this book highlights Caesar's reputation as a brilliant comic actor and describes the writing and production of the weekly live broadcast that kept 60 million TV viewers home on Saturday nights."

9781644389171,"If you like unusual travel books, then you'll enjoy Susan Snow Lukesh's study of her great aunt Agatha Snow's sketch book developed during her 3-month tour of Europe with three companions in 1912. In Agatha  Agatha Snow Abroad: A Sketch Book from her 1912 European Tour, Lukesh presents and explores the original images and brief comments, pulling threads to explore what the often-cryptic comments mean. Agatha  also explores the people she and her friends met and briefly traveled with, and what happened to the various players in this trip after it ended as the world moved into the first World War and even beyond. Although their steam ship left New York harbor barely two days after the Titanic sank and before the survivors arrived, no recorded comments from the passage to Europe mention the tragedy.Contemporary postcards and one early 19th c print complement Agatha's drawings and show how close her small sketches came to the actual sites she portrayed. The small sketch book, not even four by six inches, presents images-some with incredible detail that is best seen when the original image is enlarged, causing a reader to shake his or her head and wonder how she did it. Her favorite subjects are people and as many folks who travel know part of the fascination and interest in travel is encountering people who are quite different from those we know at home. And certainly, Agatha's images, in fact caricatures, of people capture and convey her clear fascination with the people she encountered. Agatha  supplements Agatha's comments and descriptions with diary entries and letters sent home by other contemporary accounts further enriching what may first appear as a meager offering, if judged only by size. Agatha's sketch book, and the exploration of it, offer a snapshot of life in the early 1900s during the Edwardian era-where and how folks traveled, what travelers discussed, what they did, and what they ate. Lukesh also traveled on a couple occasions to some of the very places that Agatha and companions visited. On one occasion, she found herself traveling in one of the railway cars and on the very line-both now under restoration-that Agatha and companions traveled in England. Also, in England, she traveled to see Warwick where Agatha had seen and drawn two wonderful sketches of men on the streets of that fine historic town.Agatha  not only presents the original sketches and brief comments from over 100 years ago, but includes solutions to puzzles that Agatha left us, such as what is the story of Mrs. Campbell and the Cockroaches in the Cabin, what is A.B.C., and what are horse-tail guards? Agatha  fulfills a reader's need to know what happened to the folks Agatha met and now the readers meet on the trip-both those on the ship passages to and from Europe and those met along the way in Europe. As much as possible, using public records, the lives of some of them after the trip, through World War 1 and the years after, are traced, as are the fates of the ships that carried the travelers. Not every puzzle has been solved, leaving some for readers, but many are, with great thanks to internet resources these days and Lukesh's ability to use public records for genealogical purposes and answers.A final bonus in Agatha  For decades Lukesh excavated and studied the things left behind by prehistoric folks in Southern Italy and Sicily. Today her attention has turned to things left behind by her ancestors. From a gold bracelet she wears, to an 1860s photo album, and to this sketch book of her great aunt Agatha. This exploration of a tour by four women in their 20s over 100 years ago gives insight on restoring pieces of family history based on things left behind, offering a template for organizing similar genealogy research."

9780764360428,"The practice of keeping log diaries and journals has evolved through the centuries with the growing popularity of travel for personal enrichment. Five hundred years ago, artists like Albrecht Durer and explorers like Jacques le Moyne and John White recorded their journeys in sketchbooks and journals. Picturing exotic locations was part of topographical drawing and cartography. Knowing what a destination looked like helped travelers know they had arrived. The Sketchbook Traveler carries this concept to the next level, expanding the range of plein air enthusiasts by freeing them from cumbersome easels and wet canvases. It provides the novice an introduction to plein air methods, without burdening them with costly equipment. It provides educators with teaching tools and lesson plans, and professional artists with a way to refine their mobile practices. Through drawing, painting, and journal keeping, The Sketchbook Traveler guides readers toward more mindful engagement with the world around them, deepening knowledge and enriching their personal experience in ways that make every day an adventure."

9780358380207,"This richly illustrated book celebrates in words and pictures the beautiful work that award-winning artist Alan Lee produced for J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit,  and includes dozens of brand-new paintings and pencil drawings exploring the world of Bilbo Baggins. Since The Hobbit was first published in 1937, generations of readers have fallen under its spell. That magic was reignited sixty years later when Alan Lee was commissioned to produce a special illustrated edition, and his delicate pencil drawings and beautiful watercolor paintings have become for many the definitive vision of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth.  In this sumptuous, large-format hardback, Alan Lee reveals in pictures and in words how he created these images, which would prove so powerful, matching perfectly with Tolkien's own vision, that they would eventually define the look of Peter Jackson's film adaptations and earn Alan a coveted Academy Award. The Hobbit Sketchbook is filled with more than 100 of Lee's sketches and early conceptual pieces, which reveal how the project progressed from idea to finished art. It also contains a wealth of brand-new full-color paintings and sketches drawn specially for this book, which unlock the secrets of how Alan creates his own magic and provide a fascinating insight into the imagination of the man who breathed new life into Tolkien's vision."

9798687416863,"Watercolor is a wonderful, versatile medium - and one that scares many beginners out of their wits  When you're an absolute beginner, figuring out the basics of watercolor can be quite daunting. And the problem is, most watercolor artists forget what it was like to be a novice. As a result, many watercolor guides assume a lot of things they think beginners should already know. It can leave you with a lot of unanswered questions. We'd like to introduce you to what I think are the fundamental basics of watercolors, so you can actually learn something useful and feel more confident in your skills. Watercolor can be intimidating for beginners, and even some experienced artists find it challenging. With Painting with Watercolor Sketchbook, you'll begin to understand how watercolor really works, get comfortable with your paints, and hopefully come up with ideas for new creations."

9789814610827,"For a long while, Lisbon was a sleeping beauty. From its heyday in the 15th and 16th centuries, rooted in the Age of Discovery, to the end of Salazar’s dictatorial regime in 1974, the city lived at a slower pace than the rest of Europe. With its nomination as European Cultural Capital in 1994, it suddenly found itself in the spotlight. Lisbon sits on the north bank of the Tagus, not far from the mouth of the river, and straddles the undulating terrain formed by seven hills. Thanks to fortunes amassed during the Age of Discovery, and in spite of the terrible earthquake of 1755, the Portuguese capital has a rich and varied architectural heritage. Every hilltop bears a castle or church, its slopes criss-crossed with networks of steep alleyways bordered with small colourful houses, while the slightest expanse of flat ground allows Baroque and Classical edifices to prosper. Even the banks of the Tagus are now home to world class contemporary architecture. At a time when Lisbon’s population and socio-economic fabric is undergoing majortransformations, Gonçalo Tavares and Fabrice Moireau have captured the city’s atmosphere and essence, restoring its timeless magic, its unfailing charm and its unrestrained modernity."

9783836566971,"As this volume opens we find our hero at age 46, solidly into the midlife crises years. Crumb has lived his entire life in anxious, introspective, self-flagellating crises, however, so the middle years bring only a refinement of his lifelong turmoil and further honing of artistic talent. More words accompany the drawings, demonstrating Crumb's brilliant powers of observation, as in a long paragraph devoted to an encounter with one of brother Maxon's vegan turds, and a poetic paean to the heartbreak of life and aging. The family's move to Sauve, France, in 1991 is heralded by a switch from portraits of apple-cheeked American girls sketched while waiting for food in California cafes to portraits of girls in French cafes, by pastorals of rampant French countryside, and by haunting tableau of homeless beggars in the Metro.The most notable new character in this sketchbook is a turbaned holy man named, by young Sophie Crumb, Roman Dodo, who seems loosely inspired by Robert's brother Maxon. Patricia Pig, a cheerful human/porcine hybrid also debuts, alongside portraits of girlfriends present and past.As the artist advances into his mid-50s, towards the end of the volume, fantasies of regression to childhood dependence on strong female figures, and even of a good death, carried away on the back of a sturdy young angel, speak less of angst than acceptance of the aging process. Our curmudgeon finds a measure of peace, a certain French acceptance, of the cruel whims of fate. Until the final pages, when he pronounces himself, out of nowhere, ""such a fucking QUEER.""All in all, another killer volume."

9784805315361,"Tokyo Travel Sketchbook traces the journey of illustrator and graphic designer Amaia Arrazola on a four-week trip through the beating heart of Tokyo. When Arrazola accepts a month long artist's residency in the Japanese capital, she has little idea of what to expect but gamely packs her paints and pencils and seizes the opportunity to create an illustrated diary of her time there, filling the pages of her sketchbooks with curious images of life in the world's largest city. This book provides readers with a unique vision of Japan's capital, as seen through the eyes of an artist. Arrazola immerses herself in the cult of Hello Kitty and the pop-eyed charms of Kawaii cute culture, while conveying the collision of traditional and modern Japanese culture in the female Samurais she meets and draws. The city's cultural curiosities come alive in a metropolis that is ever on the go, as she browses sex shops, drinks pink coffee, eats spaghetti sandwiches and photographs subway sleepers. Throughout her explorations, Arrazola uses the concept of wabi sabi as a guiding principle--coming to see her own life and artworks as examples of flawed beauty and imperfectly perfect Zen design. The result is a fresh, often funny, one-of-a-kind look at a city that works hard and plays hard--in many surprising ways. At the heart of Tokyo Travel Sketchbook are two contradictory Japans--the glittering neon world of a high-tech ultramodern society existing side-by-side with a nation where ancient tradition holds sway and where the unadorned, the simple and the silent are prized and celebrated as much as the new, the fashionable and the trendy. These competing realities make for a memorable visual journey and a stunning souvenir of a stranger's brief stay in a strange land. From smoking laws to high-tech toilets, Arrazola finds beauty in the weirdness and imperfection of this modern metropolis. *Recommended for readers ages 14 & up*"

9780008226749,"This richly illustrated book celebrates in words and pictures the beautiful work that award-winning artist Alan Lee produced for J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit, and includes dozens of brand-new paintings and pencil drawings exploring the world of Bilbo Baggins. Since The Hobbit was first published in 1937, generations of readers have fallen under its spell. That magic was reignited sixty years later, when Alan Lee was commissioned to produce a special illustrated edition, and his delicate pencil drawings and beautiful watercolour paintings have become for many the definitive vision of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth. In this sumptuous, large-format hardback Alan Lee reveals in pictures and in words how he created these images, which would prove so powerful, matching perfectly with Tolkien's own vision, that they would eventually define the look of Peter Jackson's film adaptations and earn Alan a coveted Academy Award. The Hobbit Sketchbook is filled with more than 100 of his sketches and early conceptual pieces that reveal how the project progressed from idea to finished art. It also contains a wealth of brand-new full-colour paintings and sketches drawn specially for this book, which unlock the secrets of how Alan creates his own magic and provide a fascinating insight into the imagination of the man who breathed new life into Tolkien's vision."

9783037785850,"Active at the Bauhaus between 1920 and 1931, teaching in the bookbinding, stained glass and mural-painting workshops, Paul Klee (1879-1940) brought his expressive blend of color and line to the school--and, with the second volume in the Bauhausb cher series, beyond its walls. In his legendary Pedagogical Sketchbook, Klee presents his theoretical approach to drawing using geometric shapes and lines. Evincing a desire to reunite artistic design and craft, and written in a tone that oscillates between the seeming objectivity of the diagram, the rhetoric of science and mathematics, and an abstract, quasi-mystical intuition, Klee's text expresses key aspects of the Bauhaus' pedagogy and guiding philosophies. And while Klee's method is deeply personal, in the context of the fundamentally multivocal Bauhaus, his individual approach to abstract form is typical in its idiosyncrasy. In the Pedagogical Sketchbook, Klee presents his own theories about the relationships between line, form, surface, color, space and time in art in the context of the Bauhaus. The book testifies to Klee's intensive theoretical explorations of art and exemplifies how the Bauhaus masters interconnected the various realms of art and design. In the present volume, the 1953 English translation of Pedagogical Sketchbook by Sibyl Moholy-Nagy is combined with the design and physical qualities of the original German edition from 1925."

Now everything Crumb is fast increasing in value; the perfect time for R. Crumb Sketchbook, Volume 3: Jan. 1975–Dec. 1982.Combining volumes 5 and 6 from the second R. Crumb Sketchbook boxed set, and produced directly from the original artworks now belonging to an ardent French collector, this is one big 444-page Crumb feast for way less than his rare originals. Among the hundreds of subjects included are Crumb’s move to rural California, his marriage to Aline Kominsky, the birth of daughter Sophie, as well as further adventures of Mr. Natural, mischievous Snoids, Arcade comics strips, political discontent, existential angst, huge powerful women, geeky little guys, Mao Tse Tung, Mick Jagger and moral outrage, all wrapped up in a quality hard cover featuring front and back illustrations newly hand-colored by Crumb himself.“There’s something irreconcilable at the heart of this work… which is at odds with much contemporary art.

During a period of two decades, he had developed silk making from being a static village craft into a dynamic textile industry providing exquisite silks for both the Thai domestic and international markets.

Crumb Sketchbooks: 1982–2011, fans drooled over the gorgeous packaging of this six-volume boxed set, the artist’s thoughtful editing, the hand-written introduction, marbleized page edges, and signed Crumb colored art print.

Crumb Sketchbook, Volume 2: Sept. 1968 – Jan. 1975 combines the two middle volumes from the second boxed set, produced directly from the original artworks now belonging to an ardent French collector, into one fat 444-page Crumb feast, at an irresistible price. This book contains hundreds of sketches from the master of underground comic art, including cover roughs for Zap, Motor City and Despair comics, the introduction of Aline, the first female Yetis, Flakey Foont and Mr. Natural, Honeybunch Kaminski, San Francisco drug culture and big buoyant butts, all wrapped up in a quality hard cover featuring front and back illustrations newly hand-colored by Crumb himself."

Combining informative and entertaining vignettes, stories, and notes with stunning full-color illustrations, she draws parallels between the city and the art it inspires. Organized around four main principles of art—color, pattern, perspective, and rhythm—Impressions of Paris is a celebration of the artistic spark in the city’s mundane yet marvelous details: the pistachio and cassis palette triggered by the ice cream case at Berthillon; how a rainy stroll through an open air market transforms into a smudgy gouache (pronounced gwash) pattern; the lovely ubiquity of the iconic French stripe, the Breton.Pretty and inventive, surprising and stimulating, Impressions of Paris captures the beauty and charms of this stunning city and extols its power to stimulate the creative imagination—inviting artists and art appreciators to intimately experience a painter’s process."

The second part focuses on complete aircraft, depicting military and commercial single-, twin-, and multi-engine planes.Formed in 1912, Lockheed Aircraft Corporation was a leading WWII aircraft manufacturer and was responsible for the only plane in production throughout the entire war, the P-38 Lightning. Lockheed's Chief Engineer, Hall L. Hibbard, states the book's intention in the Preface: to give the designer a collection of ideas, in sketch form, that will stimulate his own creative and inventive mind.

9781770498549,"A unique First World War diary, illustrated with more than a hundred stunning pencil sketches, for children learning history and also for adults interested in a new perspective on the War and authentic wartime artefacts. Russell Rabjohn was just eighteen years old when he joined up to fight in the First World War. In his three years of soldiering, he experienced the highs and lows of army life, from a carefree leave in Paris to the anguish of seeing friends die around him. Like many soldiers, he defied army regulations and recorded everything he saw and felt in a small pocket diary. Private Rabjohn was a trained artist, and as such he was assigned to draw dugouts, map newly captured trenches, and sketch the graves of his fallen comrades. This allowed him to carry an artist's sketchbook on the battlefield--a freedom he put to good use, drawing everything he saw. Here, in vivid detail, are images of the captured pilot of a downed German biplane; the horrific Flanders mud; a German observation balloon exploding in midair; and the jubilant mood in the streets of Belgium when the Armistice is finally signed. With no surviving veterans of the First World War, Rabjohn's drawings are an unmatched visual record of a lost time. Award-winning author John Wilson brings his skills as a historian and researcher to bear, carefully curating the diary to provide context and tell the story of Private Rabjohn's war. He has selected each of the diary entries and the accompanying images, and has provided the background that modern-day readers need to understand what a young soldier went through a century ago. The result is a wonderfully detailed and dramatic account of the war as seen through an artist's eyes."

9781419725944,"“The most revolutionary discovery in the entire history of Van Gogh’s oeuvre. Not one drawing; not ten, not fifty, but sixty-five drawings.”  —Ronald Pickvance, from the Foreword Late in life, during his time living in Provence, Vincent van Gogh kept a sketchbook within a humble account ledger given to him by Joseph and Marie Ginoux, the owners of the Café de la Gare in Arles. This artifact of incalculable historical and aesthetic value remained hidden for more than one hundred and twenty years. It reappears today as a revelation and an extraordinary treasure. Published in this volume for the first time, Van Gogh’s lost sketchbook tells a riveting story. Over two tumultuous years in the artist’s life, he drew sixty-five sketches, including landscapes, still lifes, portraits, and a self-portrait, within the ledger. These priceless drawings provide insight into the last years of Van Gogh’s life, just before his fatal stay in Auvers-sur-Oise, and a new understanding of his most famous paintings, such as The Yellow House, The Night Café, and The Starry Night. With meticulous analysis of the sketchbook and the historical record, art historian Bogomila Welsh-Ovcharov discusses each drawing in terms of Van Gogh’s career as a whole, and in particular during his time in Arles and Saint-Rémy-de-Provence between February 1888 and May 1890. This groundbreaking book includes facsimile reproductions of all the sketches and is richly illustrated with dozens of drawings, photographs, and paintings that situate the sketchbook in the context of Van Gogh’s life’s work and the history of art. The result of a remarkable discovery, Vincent van Gogh: The Lost Arles Sketchbook offers fresh insight into the life and work of one of the world’s most beloved artists. "

Inspired by the sketch crawls that have been embraced by artists around the world, this book will breathe fresh air into your art life. Inside you'll find 20 slice-of-life workshops, presented by 12 accomplished artists. Each workshop is comprised of various challenges that ask you to slow down, look closer and explore the endless, often unexpected sketching opportunities in the world around you. These prompts will take you from bustling bars and crowed beaches to workplaces and deserted stadiums. You'll draw candid figures in motion and posed portraits of intriguing personalities you meet along the way. You'll be challenged to convey the sensory experience of a meal, the fleeting view through your passenger window and a day in the life of a child. Your subjects will range from popular landmarks and performing musicians to fire hydrants, shoes and sushi. You will never again be stuck for what to draw. Pages are richly illustrated with the contributing artists' sketches, showing how they interpreted the exercises. The experience is exalting, and the payoff is profound, including a greater sense of observation, more expressive mark-making and deeper connections with your subjects. Create sketchbooks alive with atmosphere, fond memories and beautiful, everyday stories--both great and small--told as only you can."

Most designers sketch their designs on top of ""croquis,"" or pre- rinted body outlines. However, until now, the standard croquis for women have shown elongated, stick-thin, unnaturally proportioned, and off-balance bodies. In Gertie's New Fashion Sketchbook, loved house author and fashion-sewing celebrity Gretchen Hirsch teams up with illustrator Sun Young Park to reinvent the traditional croquis for the 21st century, with hundreds of croquis depicting realistically sized and proportioned body shapes in balanced, life-like poses. Also included are an overview of the design and sketching process and a visual history of garment component styles to empower designers/sewists to create sketches for ashion that will be flattering for women of all shapes and sizes."

Following the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the city's identity evolved to be modern, tolerant and at times even eccentric. This identity was forged by the reunion of two close but disparate populations. On one side, Berliners lived in a city of right angles: grey, dull, comfortless, with uniformity as dogma. On the other, the architecture was more traditional and eclectic, and the lifestyle much more comfortable. Today, thanks to the successful reunification, Berlin is becoming one of the most visited capitals in Europe. In his Berlin Sketchbook, artist Fabrice Moireau – ever passionate about urban architecture – captures both the iconic sites and hidden corners of Germany's capital, bringing out the best of the city."

9781590176184,"An NYRB Classics Original Few writers had to confront as many of the last century's mass tragedies as Vasily Grossman, who wrote with terrifying clarity about the Shoah, the Battle of Stalingrad, and the Terror Famine in the Ukraine. An Armenian Sketchbook, however, shows us a very different Grossman, notable for his tenderness, warmth, and sense of fun. After the Soviet government confiscated--or, as Grossman always put it, ""arrested""--Life and Fate, he took on the task of revising a literal Russian translation of a long Armenian novel. The novel was of little interest to him, but he needed money and was evidently glad of an excuse to travel to Armenia. An Armenian Sketchbook is his account of the two months he spent there. This is by far the most personal and intimate of Grossman's works, endowed with an air of absolute spontaneity, as though he is simply chatting to the reader about his impressions of Armenia--its mountains, its ancient churches, its people--while also examining his own thoughts and moods. A wonderfully human account of travel to a faraway place, An Armenian Sketchbook also has the vivid appeal of a self-portrait."

9783037783122,"While Floating Images: Souto de Moura's Wall Atlas explores the architect's visual archive as the basis for his work, Sketchbook No. 76 focuses on his concrete sketches. The publication is a reproduction of his sketchbook and gives insight into the architectural design process, which here can be quite literally experienced and understood. The publication records his first ideas, fleeting sketches, studies, and spontaneous jottings that offer a starting point for every project but also function as a working resource for developing existing ideas further and trying out any number of variants. Sketchbook No. 76 is a homage to the medium of drawing and makes it clear that it remains an essential element of the creative process."

The drawings contained within it represent the entire range of animation development, from the origins of ideas to fully conceived characters. Pencil studies of a much-younger Wendy and a serpentlike sea witch reveal the many imaginative iterations that animators create before they ultimately perfect every hero and villain. And comprehensive studies of Mickey and Baloo showcase the dedication that goes into defining the facial expressions and body language of each beloved character.Films and shorts from throughout the history of the company are featured-beginning with Steamboat Willie and ending with Tangled-demonstrating the ingenuity and skill that have remained a constant at Walt Disney Animation Studios since 1928.

9781479169207,"Technology bombards us with new inventions and innovations almost daily. But when presented with a new gizmo or gadget, an artist's first thought (even if not spoken aloud) is usually: Yeah that's nice...but can I make art with it The personal computer was co-opted almost immediately by wily artists painting one pixel at a time or even drawing with text in the form of ASCII art. The computer has advanced quickly as a tool that artists use to express and create. In fact, many modern illustrators and comic artists work almost exclusively in digital form. So it is no surprise that the advent of the smartphone and the tablet quickly developed the capabilities to create on the go. Many software packages have thrown their hat into this arena, but one has managed to bridge the gap between the different platforms almost seamlessly; Autodesk SketchBook. In this book we will explore the PC/Mac, Tablet, and Mobile versions of Autodesk SketchBook. We will talk about what is similar and what is different about each platform and how it can serve artists in the office, at home, or on the move. But most importantly we will talk about how artists can use it to create art."

9781781391716,"The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius is a life-changing book. Among others, it contains the following reflections: ""The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts."" ""You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength."" ""When you arise in the morning, think of what a privilege it is to be alive, to think, to enjoy, to love ..."" ""It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live."" ""Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth."" The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius is a life-changing book. It contains the private meditations of the most powerful man in the Roman world, the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, as he wrestled with the complexities of his life using the wisdom of Stoic Philosophy. Meditations is written in lucid, accessible language and, interestingly, we see that the problems and perplexities of this philosopher-King are much like ours. Marcus Aurelius was impressively able to live out his philosophical ideals-such as the importance of gratitude, mindfulness, simplicity and life-long learning, of seizing the day, and of remembering the shortness of life-while administering the Roman Empire.Marcus Aurelius (121-180 AD) was the last of the five ""good Roman emperors"". The Emperor Hadrian adopted Titus Aurelius Antoninus, thereby choosing him to succeed him, and arranged for Antonius to adopt Marcus, and thus, from a young age, Marcus was groomed for power. During this time, he devoted himself to philosophy with passion and diligence. At the age of forty he became Emperor and was known as Emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus. Remarkably in a culture of absolute power, he insisted that his adoptive brother and co-consul, Lucius, be elevated to co-emperor. The historian Herodian, a contemporary, wrote: ""he gave proof of his learning not by mere words or knowledge of philosophical doctrines but by his blameless character and temperate way of life.""Marcus Aurelius is now best remembered for Meditations, which is, perhaps, the greatest single work of Stoic philosophy.Stoic philosophy is, above all, practical. It uses reason and the careful observation of human life to address the problems of daily life. It is also universal-the Emperor Marcus Aurelius and the freed slave Epictetus were both prominent Stoic philosophers. In recent years, Stoic philosophy has provided invaluable life lessons to people in many spheres of life including prisoners of war and Holocaust survivors, psychiatrists, and those in the business world. Indeed, modern Stoic thought ""hold[s] fascinating promise for business and government leaders tackling global problems in a turbulent, post-recession slump,"" (Forbes).This edition is complete and unabridged and contains Introduction, Notes, Appendix containing correspondence with his tutor Fronto, and a number of illustrations and both an index and index of terms.

Although his passionate interest in new technologies has led him to develop a virtuosic drawing technique on the iPad, he has also traveled outdoors with a traditional sketchbook, an invaluable tool as he works quickly to capture the changing light and fleeting effects of the weather. Executed in watercolor and ink, these panoramic scenes have the spatial complexity of finished paintings--the broad sweep of sky or road, the patchwork tapestry of land--yet convey the immediacy of Hockney's impressions. For those who know the East Yorkshire Wolds, the location of the sketches is unmistakable; for those who don't, its features will come to life in these pages."

9781429045247,"Author Harriet Robinson (1825-1911), born Harriet Jane Hanson in Boston, offers a first person account of her life as a factory girl in Lowell, Massachusetts in this 1898 work. Robinson moved with her widowed mother and three siblings to Lowell as the cotton industry was booming, and began working as a bobbin duffer at the age of ten for $2 a week. Her reflections of the life, some 60 years later, are unfailingly upbeat. She was educated, in public school, by private lesson, and in church. The community was tightly knit. She also had the opportunity to write poetry and prose for the factory girls' literary magazine The Lowell Offering. When mill girls returned to their rural family homes, she says, ""...instead of being looked down upon as 'factory girls, ' they were more often welcomed as coming from the metropolis, bringing new fashions, new books, and new ideas with them."

9780500093337,"A facsimile edition of the only surviving sketchbook by this visionary Romantic painter, published to coincide with a retrospective exhibition of Palmer's work.Child prodigy Samuel Palmer was just fourteen years old when he first exhibited at London's Royal Academy in 1819. A delicate and withdrawn child, he experienced intense and disturbing visions as a boy, while developing a love of the Bible and poetry that remained a lifelong inspiration for his art. Under the tutelage of William Blake and John Linnell, he became the most visionary and mystical landscape painter of the Romantic era in England.This beautiful volume is a facsimile of the only sketchbook by Palmer in existence. Its pages vividly illustrate the crucial period when Palmer was a nineteen-year-old artist in rural Kent trying to establish his mature style. Religious fervor, the influence of Linnell, and the inspiration of Blake all combined to reveal to Palmer a vision of a divinely ordered heaven on Earth located in the landscape. No other surviving source provides such an immediate record of Palmer's processes of discovery, or gives such insight into the self-searching, artistic, and spiritual struggles that were soon to be resolved in his celebrated moonlit landscapes of the 1820s and 1830s.All of the sketchbook's 162 surviving pagesnewly photographed in color, finely reproduced, and printed on paper resembling that of the originalare presented in their original sequence and at their actual size. Martin Butlin provides authoritative page-by-page commentaries, notes, and an introduction to Palmer's life, while William Vaughan places the sketchbook in the context of the art and aesthetic of its time. 160 color illustrations."

And it's probably because Zits is the best depiction of life with a teenager since, well, ever!Pimp My Lunch: Zits Sketchbook No. 10 Zits chronicles the daily lives of a teen in a way that's not done in the popular media-with respect. Having teenagers in the house is like having a front-row seat to one of life's great passages, says Jim Borgman. Zits tries to respect that period by taking a sympathetic view of all the players involved-the parents, as well as the kids. We like to think of Zits as the antidote to all of the bad stuff you read about teenagers today, adds Jerry Scott. Many people believe that modern adolescence is all about gangs, guns, drugs etc. Zits gives a different view of the teenage experience where, for most kids, relationships, friendships, school, and sports are the stuff of daily life. Zits levels the playing field and often causes (gasp!) communication to occur between kids and their parents. Appearing in over 1,200 newspapers worldwide, this enormously popular comic strip has been a staple since it was first syndicated in 1997."

,傳奇筆記本 - 袖珍旅遊伴侶版品尺寸：13.5*21cm規格：100頁高品質純白紙張繪圖冊Moleskine 產品特色：Moleskine筆記本的堅固Moleskine封面，緊密訂裝的外邊，配備有可擴展的內部硬紙板製筆記支架和布製小袋，還有一個可移動的Moleskine歷史說明卡。傳奇筆記本歷史MOLESKINE在二十世紀已經成為歐洲藝術家和知識份子手中的傳奇筆記本，由梵高(Van Gogh)到亨利馬蒂斯(Henri Matisse)，甚至一些極具代表性的歷史人物。很多草稿、筆記，計劃，構思甚至激動的情感都在變成名畫及驚世之作之前，被一一記錄及收藏在這本可靠及信賴的袖珍旅遊伴侶之上。這個存在已久的傳統被旅遊作家Bruce Chatwin傳播下去。他在Rue de l' Ancienne Comedie一間巴黎文具店購買他的Moleskine產品。在每次出國展開他的新旅程之前，他都必定會先購入足夠的Moleskine筆記本，數年之後，漸漸變成了他的老習慣。在他未選用Moleskine筆記本之前，他需要自己在簿內記下每頁的數字，更為怕有一天遺失了他的筆記本，他在內頁寫下他的名字和最少兩個不同國家的地址，更寫下留言承諾假若誰拾到並交還此筆記本定必收到報酬。他更把此方法建議給他的好友Luis Sepulveda。當Chatwin第一次送Moleskine產品給他作旅遊前的禮物，他們二人便計劃開始合力於Patagonia承辦Moleskine。那時候，根本不用懷疑Moleskine有多珍貴，因為連最後一個Moleskine廠商，一家家庭形式運作的小公司都已在1986年停產。“Moleskine已經停產”這一句簡單短小的句子就是Chatwin去澳洲之前購買一百本Moleskine的文具店的解釋。並不誇張，他找到的Moleskine對他來說根本還未足夠。現在，Moleskine正式回來了！這個謹慎樸素，包含著非凡的傳統的保管者曾被遺失多年。現在開始又回復它的旅程。正要見證你的流浪生活，把你的故事一個一個的延伸下去。Moleskine留下空白的一頁，正等待你隨之而來發生的事去填滿它們，繼續你的故事。

4712972340195,《豆皮少年》是熱寫生成團之後所推出的首張全創作專輯。以日常做為支點以隱喻包圍時間，企圖用音樂捕捉生命之中那些一閃即逝的微觀風景，用話語緊緊抱住隨時可能脫焦的生活樣貌。專輯以吉他／民謠／另類作為基底，並適度地在編曲之中加入了不同層次的和聲編排與其他種類的音樂元素，你可以在「在船底搔癢」中聽到afrobeat的基因貫穿全曲，也可以在「塔悠」、「漁夫」等歌裡面，聽到取經自90年代初期的psychedelic之音。當然，熱寫生拿手的indie-pop／country folk／garage rock 曲式，在「愛與膠囊」「青元春朗」等爽朗的男女合唱之中，進攻退守般地展露無遺。「願生活的不和諧所有，都能在換季時分沈沒。」《豆皮少年》的音樂切開了日常的各種稜角，光會反射在房間的每一個地方，而從影子堆積之處往上看，你也許就會看到太陽。——曾立宇（熱寫生主唱）商品尺寸:14.1X12.5X1CM

9789869454971,"鉛筆素描的歷史可追朔至文藝復興時代
素描工具發明後，鉛筆畫受歡迎的程度愈來愈高
即使在科技發達的今天，鉛筆素描的重要性仍有其無可取代的地位◎「基礎教學好完善」認識鉛筆材料、題材選擇、基本構圖、筆觸運用
◎「進階教學超詳細」形體認識、形體的觀察與練習、靜物表現原則、質感的表現方法
◎「示範繪圖很清楚」15大質感分類，129款靜物素描，每款主題皆細細說明繪畫要點

人類藉著鉛筆傳達思想、透過鉛筆傳達美感，手繪的魅力仍然是今天的電腦科技無法表現的，也許正因其那無法言喻的美感，時至今日鉛筆仍是學院派素描不可或缺的工具素材。

Through the decades we see how Lagerfeld incorporates eclectic infl uences―from Eskimo designs and medieval armor, to kimonos and the world of informatics―into his own progressive vision. FENDI by Karl Lagerfeld includes a sketch pad of 137 of Lagerfeld’s fashion drawings (those given to the Fendi ateliers to enable them to construct the garments, and selected from an archive of over 35,000), a pad of his logo designs for the house, along with booklets of exclusive interviews with the designer, a poster, and DVDs of his short fi lms―all packaged in a custom-made wooden case modeled on the box of oil pastels which invariably graces Lagerfeld’s working desk.

素描就是觀看與分析的藝術
肖像素描主要是關於正確分析一個物體的比例、透視、明暗、調子及陰影。
藉由這樣的分析，將所有個人特質帶入畫中。
做對了這件事，畫像的靈魂與性格就能夠栩栩展現。
想要畫的某種表情出不來？
眼睛看起來怪怪的？嘴巴像奸笑而不是微笑？
不斷修改額頭線條，卻沒發現是下巴比例不對？
覺得眼睛過小，殊不知是兩頰寬度有問題？

肖像素描的第一步，是建構出正確的頭型。
本書分「男人的頭部」、「女人的頭部」、「嬰幼兒的頭部」、「男孩與女孩的頭部」、「手部」五大部分。
作者安德魯‧路米斯以球型結合平面的畫法，解說頭部結構、比例、線條、調子、透視等知識，其概念與技巧廣為學校和專業藝術家所採用。

◎結合球型與平面的基本構造，概念化頭部素描
◎透過解剖學認識頭骨構成與五官定位

8667106507035,艾德爺爺說：「不是每個人都得成為藝術家，但每個人都需要覺得自己很棒。」這是他教孩子作畫的原點。他一輩子都在畫畫。畫畫讓他開心，他希望每個人都能在畫畫中發現自己原來也能創造，並得到創造的快樂。他認為，這件事情比藝術還重要。為了不讓孩子一開始就被「我畫不出來」的挫敗困住，沒得到快樂只得到失望，他設計出一套簡單又高明的方法，把世間萬物的樣子拆解開來，化成所有人都能畫出的點、線、幾何圖形，教孩子一步步組合，創造出無窮的世界。經過四十多年，當初用這套方法學作畫的孩子長大了，不少人成為藝術家、設計師，他們回過頭看，才發現當初令他們著迷、簡單上手的畫畫書，一點也不簡單。藝術家Caleb Neelon甚至說：「每一位受艾德爺爺啟蒙的孩子，都是藝術家。」不是作品放在藝廊賣的藝術家，而是自己生命中的藝術家。艾德爺爺認為，畫畫最重要的是單純的喜悅，但這樣單純的喜悅，卻能把人帶到很遠的地方。但艾德爺爺的簡單方法，究竟高明在哪裡？▎幾何圖形，是藝術與數理世界的根基△是天地間最堅固的結構，〇是宇宙最完美的圖形，□是世界最實用的形狀，曲線則是最優美生動的線條，這些幾何圖形在我們生活中扮演了重要的角色，也是我們從小到大都用得上的基本元素。能辨識出萬物中的三角形、圓形、方形、曲線，以及縮放、平移、疊合與旋轉的特性，是孩子建構空間感的關鍵起步。對幾何的理解越清晰，孩子的空間概念與思考邏輯就越強，創作與表達也越流利。▎用想像力的積木開展屬於自己的創作天賦艾德爺爺在本套書中用最基本的幾何圖何，一步一步示範、組合出複雜圖像，讓孩子可以輕易理解生活中的萬物皆可拆解、描繪，無形中幫助孩子消除複雜構圖的壓力與腦中的噪音，穩定不安情緒，提升專注力。艾德爺爺這套繪畫法已是家喻戶曉的普及教材，影響了美國近半世紀的許多當代藝術創作者，也是世紀中葉現代主義兒童繪本藝術的重要代表。其高明之處就在於，他的方法不但讓每個人都能開心提筆作畫，還教孩子學會觀察、建構世界。而且，在四十多年來無數家長的分享中我們看到，因此愛上作畫的不只是孩子，原本只是陪著孩子畫的父母，也常一畫就欲罷不能，一頭鑽入自己失落已久的童年。▎全套四冊，從孩子天生就愛提筆畫的本能出發，培養一生受用的基本素質．《艾德爺爺陪你畫世界》：滿足孩子對世界萬物的好奇，以超過400種海陸空交通工具、房子，還有人物、動物、表情……等等，教他們舉一反三，簡簡單單畫出自己的世界繪本。．《艾德爺爺陪你畫動物》：反映孩子熱愛生命的天性，從小小蝌蚪、瓢蟲、老鼠、青蛙、鳥兒、貓頭鷹，到大隻的獅子、恐龍、猩猩……等等52種可愛的動物朋友，培養友善、親近動物的特質。．《艾德爺爺陪你畫表情》：發展孩子與他人互動的本能，以超過300種動物與人物的喜怒哀樂，以及各種好笑、古怪的五官表情變化，和孩子一起學習表達、溝通的能力。．《艾德爺爺陪你畫車子》：發展孩子對空間與機械的興趣。從古典火車、越野賽車、卡車、馬車，到救護車，超過50種陸路載運工具，讓孩子從喜歡的車子，認識空間、機械構造與功能。

超過900幅例圖、24種動物、6種姿態速寫，
掌握「動態、外部結構、內部構造」黃金3元素，使動物躍然紙上。

◎超過900幅例圖，24種動物：
從骨骼➜肌肉，體態➜行動，從幾何結構➜流線外型，超過900張喬・威勒利親筆手稿，層層分析講解，為西方動物素描經典學習之作。
◎掌握「動態、外部結構、內部構造」黃金3元素：
以解剖學為基礎，揉合動態、外部結構和內部構造等３項元素，使其互相協調，呈現具可信度的立體感。
◎設定 30秒到2分鐘的速寫練習：
掌握動態原則，捕捉動物姿態精髓，用幾筆速寫單刀直入地呈現外型－－先畫出簡單的線條，才有大量的空間來布置細節。

動物素描和人物素描最不同處，
在於人物素描時模特兒會定住一個姿勢讓我們作畫，動物則是經常在移動，
作畫者必須信任自己的想像力和記憶力，
並經由分析和構想創造出作品。

《向大師學動物素描》為西方經典美術著作
由大師喬．威勒利說明如何用最紮實的繪畫技巧素描動物。
重點在於透過了解動物動作、分析外型、身體結構、
佐以簡易的解剖學基礎和速寫技巧，畫出充滿生命力的作品。
●首先是要畫出動線，讓人們知道物體的主要姿態為何。
●第二個步驟是在動線上建構起基本的幾何圖形，畫出外型和體積大小。
●第三個步驟是賦予這些線條血肉細節，讓畫作充滿生命力。

從動物結構、動作，大量速寫、想像練習《向大師學動物素描》並不是教你怎麼畫動物毛皮或炫技的書，
也不是要你像印表機一樣複製圖片。
你得鍛鍊出紮實的畫技，透過大量速寫與想像畫出動態動物。
而從內到外了解動物的性情、肢體結構、動作，
會讓你的作品充滿耐人尋味的細節。

鎖定具繪畫基礎的讀者群本書適合有一定繪畫基礎，並希望提高繪製動物水平的讀者，
是不斷強調基礎有多重要的「老派」書籍，
不過，任何有興趣想學動物素描或讓現有動物素描程度更進步的人，
都能從這本書獲益。"

練習建構球體與臉部塊面，以基本塊面與次級塊面建構頭部。男性頭部的骨骼與肌肉結構較厚重，塊面明顯。以單位畫頭，藉由改變單位比例，能塑造不同類型的人物。

PART2女性頭像
女性臉部之美在於比例之美，務必要先學習結構與五官如何配置。女性骨架與肌肉結構較輕巧，不要強調下顎與臉頰的肌肉，眉毛位置通常較男性高。以簡單塊面大膽表現髮絲，不要過度強調細節。

PART3嬰兒頭像
嬰兒的臉在比例上比頭骨小，眉毛以下的臉約占頭部的四分之一，臉部塊面要更短一些。畫嬰兒要把鼻梁畫低而內凹，耳朵的位置要低，雙頰要高而豐滿。在亮色調上增加強光強調。

PART4兒童與青少年頭像
兒童頭部的垂直比例約與嬰兒相仿。塊狀與方正的形體會讓小男孩有粗獷的感覺，而小女孩的輪廓線則較為圓潤。青少年的頭部比例幾乎與成人無異，骨骼結構已相當明顯，但不用像畫成年人的頭部那樣強調。

PART5手部
手的比例由中指決定，留意手背的弧線，及如何勾勒凹陷的掌心。若手看起來無法緊握物品，就是畫糟了。

無論你是初學者，還是多年習畫者，本書分為「男性頭像」、「女性頭像」、「嬰兒頭像」、「兒童與青少年頭像」、「手部」五大繪畫主題，專章說明不同生理性別、不同年齡層（老、少、幼）、不同細節（眼、耳、鼻、口、手）的肖像素描原則。全書66組頭手圖解、41組清晰圖例，內容鉅細靡遺，帶領讀者循序漸進地刻畫出靈活生動的人物肖像畫。

每隻龍都有不同的「龍格」、情緒和姿態，
本書提供了詳盡的指南，
帶領你一步一步掌握所有竅門和技巧
把你想要的個性和特色，

前肢、雙翼、腿型擴大至全身輪廓，
逐步教你從細節到整體的繪畫技法。

接下來，透過添加細節與特徵，
賦予角色獨特設定，
例如龍身處的環境，以及牠本身性格的善與惡。
這時你可以加點彎曲的螺旋角或鍬形的尾巴來表達牠的活潑，
或是波浪狀的光滑鱗片，讓牠們看起來閃亮柔軟。

最後則是研究龍在作品中的動態，
動態姿勢能加強牠的氣勢與魅力，
不論是優雅的坐臥姿，
還是危險的蟄伏、兇猛的攻擊姿，
透過與背景的結合，創造出躍然紙上的巨龍。

描繪這些神奇的生物祕訣在於耐心，
你必須要有百折不撓的精神練習再練習，
爾後無論是兇猛的戰士龍、年長的智者龍，
初生的幼龍或者慈祥的母龍，
你都能以一支鉛筆帶給牠們靈動的生命！

只要小心，在要求龍當你的模特兒時，
千萬要確認牠的心情是否良好。"

每天只要運用2分鐘，學會所有繪畫技能！

◎隨書附贈 超值「繪畫顯像板」

學繪畫，就好比要掌握一項運動或學習彈奏樂器。在掌握了基本原理後，想要更進一步就只能靠不斷的練習。在本書，作者會邀請你一起嘗試畫一些新主題，並使用一些特別的作畫工具。

本書中的練習是以五項感知作畫技能而設計的。這五項技能是在你每一次的作畫中都要運用到的，通過練習，你能把五項技能融為一體，掌握整體的繪畫技巧。只是所畫的題材和所用的工具改變了。

它提供能鍛鍊各項基本功的繪畫素材，同時附上簡單的說明，列出大概需要的時間（雖然這可能會因每個人的繪畫速度而不同），還會提供合適的繪畫空間，已經畫好的邊框和一些按每幅畫的正確比例標好的十字線。在大多數練習的後面也附上注釋，包括一些補充的資訊及建議。

每次畫畫遇到的最大困難，應該是如何騰出時間來做這些繪畫練習。
作者向大家推薦一個很有效的方法，就是所謂的「2分鐘繪畫」，一位臨床心理學家就是用這種方法來促使那些不願做運動的人做運動的。醫生讓這些人對自己說：「我現在沒有太多時間散步，我就走2分鐘好了。」一旦他們真的開始走了，他們通常就會忘了自己不願散步的理由並一直走下去，直至遠遠超過了2分鐘。而我是這樣運用「2分鐘」的方法，完成我所有的繪畫。
●從0開始學繪畫！每天2分鐘，看到什麼都能畫。
●9到99歲都能開始畫，跟著書中簡單的方法，學會五項技巧，看到什麼都能畫。
●全球擁有百萬學生的繪畫名師，開發右腦的簡單繪畫練習，增加創造力！

現在，把這本書連同鉛筆、橡皮擦一起放在隨手可及的地方，稍坐一刻，把書拿在手裡，對自己說：「我現在不是要畫畫，我只是把書翻到下一個練習的那一頁而已。」然後，再跟自己說：「我不是真的要畫畫，我只是想用鉛筆作一些初步的記號而已。」接著，「我不是真的要畫畫，我只是在圖畫的範圍內畫一些草圖而已……」這樣一步一步地進行下去，很快你就會發現，原來自己已經畫好一幅完整的畫了。而時間也在不知不覺中過去了。

就這樣每天2分鐘的練習，妳將會掌握所有的繪畫技巧，看到什麼都能畫！

然而，隨著年齡逐漸增長、進入學校接受制式教育以後，繪畫所強調的重點和關注的焦點，慢慢地轉移，轉向力求逼真表現。於是，每個人在兒時從繪畫中獲得的自由和快樂，就此消失。後來，還能夠動手畫畫的，往往只剩下少數被認為具有特殊天分的人了。

從此之後，我們已經沒有信心再拿起筆在紙上畫畫，就連從事創意產業的人，都對於徒手畫畫也產生恐懼。近年來，這個現象愈加明顯，許多藝術院校的學子更傾向於使用數位技術來製圖。

為什麼我們對繪畫的熱情會隨著成長而壓抑呢？這是多麼遺憾的事！因此，本書希望帶你重返童年時代，單純享受在紙上留下痕跡的過程。

首先，在本書中我們要探討線條和記號的繪製， 這在繪畫藝術中是非常核心的部分。接著是了解如何使用明暗，塑造出形狀。到第三章，我們要探索一項看起來相當棘手的任務──如何在平面的畫紙上表現出三度的（three-dimensional）物體。然後，我們將了解如何替繪畫注入動態感。再來，我們會打開思路，運用肌理和圖案，嘗試各種可能性。最後，鼓勵你消除對於繪畫的成見，激發出探索創造的精神。

傳統的繪畫教學總是令人眼花繚亂，好像高不可攀，然而，本書突破教條，以65招簡單的練習，幫你克服面對繪畫時的恐懼，建立信心，從此愛上繪畫，不再因創意受阻而煩惱。"

繪畫是一項總括性的或「整體的」技能，它只需要有限的一組基本成分。它就像開車、游泳一樣，學會了基本的技巧之後，且很難再忘記。

本書讓你用右腦學習繪畫，用繪畫開發右腦。教你在5天之內學會繪畫技巧，掌握繪畫的精髓。且透過右腦開發的研究、練習，激發你的創造力潛能，你可以像愛因斯坦、達文西等天才，反轉你的大腦，看見不同的世界。了解了藝術家心中觀看世界的方式，你也可以學會像藝術家一樣的思考。

開發右腦
作者長期從事藝術及研究工作，她對諾貝爾醫學獎得主史培利的大腦研究產生極大興趣。史培利認為大腦有兩種思維模式，有L和R模式，一般人則大部分習慣了左腦思維模式。她很快將這個醫學成果應用到美術教學上，得到意想不到的結果。使用右腦思維，她的學生們第一天的作品和第五天的作品竟有天壤之別，連學生自己都難以相信。除了能力的提升，有些作品更展現了令人驚歎的繪畫技巧。

五天學會繪畫
愛德華的繪畫技巧，分成五項基本技能：對邊線的感知、對空間的感知、對相互關係的感知、對光線和陰影的感知、整體和完形的感知。書中有練習和範例，讓你學會五種感知技能。一但熟悉了，你不知不覺就能成為一個繪畫高手。

學會天才的思考方式
學習繪畫的過程，就是重新觀察這個世界、重新理解這個世界的過程。天才之所以是天才，完全是因為用了不同的思考方式，他們天生習慣右腦，習慣用左手，有許多知名的人物都是左撇子，如愛因斯坦、卓別林、富蘭克林、達文西等等。書中透析藝術家是如何思考，敎妳如何開啟左腦轉到右腦的關鍵入口，破除舊規，讓你學會這樣的轉換模式，給你想像、感知、直覺和創意，看見不同的世界。

繪畫和寫字一樣簡單
當你面對空白紙面不知如何下筆的時候，作者也理解了這樣的難處。書中你會學習到驚人的顛倒畫法、陰形畫法，以一個嶄新的角度學習繪畫，你會發現，原來自己的潛能無可限量，完全可以複製大師的作品。

藝術家的「一個單位」
學會大師是如何開始的。任何繪畫，都是先從一個單位開始。書中敎你看到一幅畫面時，如何找到最基本的一個單位，第一筆要從何開始，什麼是適合的媒材，學會了這個，你也可以輕鬆的畫出自畫像。

運用色彩的技巧
在這新的篇章，作者用簡單易懂的方式，讓你了解彩色繽紛的世界。說明顏色的無窮魅力和相互之間的關係，你能學習到重要技巧，讓你使用顏色完全得心應手，畫出具有個人特色且有美感的圖畫。

激發創造力
五天之後，你的世界完全不一樣了。你學會了如何用心裡的觀景窗看事物，且想像力無限，可以將眼前所見的一一畫下來，對於一些難解的問題也有了答案。透過繪畫的練習，可以不斷地重新發現這個世界。

本書的驚人成就
本書自美出版22年以來，風靡全世界，除了在亞馬遜上一直是讀者強烈推薦的五顆星好書，也成為各大企業、學校等單位開發創造力的指定用書。就如同作者所說，繪畫讓你更了解自己，開發右腦可以讓你從新的角度解決問題，剝開從未看見的內在。透過開發右腦，藉由繪畫的練習，學習控制自己的大腦，你可以看見的，就不單只是一物的表面。

We have to keep reminding ourselves that they were not drawn in New York, London, and Paris of the twenty-first century but in the sensation-hungry, inflation-fed milieu of the Weimar Republic.""On an Expense Account,"" for example, shows a well-fed businessman and his wife. We see only his back and neck, note her tastelessly modish skirts, and we know the whole story. ""Total Devotion from 5:00 to 7:00"" is a cocktail-bar scene, and in the dancing of the slick-haired man and the posture of his partner there is something depraved because it is only sensual. ""Lunch"" depicts a matron with unmistakably porcine features holding knife and fork affectedly as she swills. Her dining partner needs no animalization; the blas  bag below his eye, the expression, and the fold below his chin are enough.Can prostitutes, contrary to sentimental folklore, appear smug, bloated with satisfaction, and wallowing in cheap gratification? See ""Transit Trade"" to realize the effects of mindless materialism. Schiller wrote, ""Swim if you can and if you are too weak, sink."" Grosz takes this as his text for a compelling contrast between rich and poor in just two figures that completely refute the  bermensch doctrine. Hemingway in Nada did not depict more tellingly the utter despair of empty lives in the hour when the caf  closes than does Grosz in ""They Don't Sing Any More."" Love Above All? We are only partway through this portfolio when we realize suddenly how bitterly sarcastic is the title.But the mordant eye, angry wit, and social consciences of Grosz were shared by many of his period. What lifts his art above the transient event is his supremely eloquent use of pen and brush. No one has more expressively, piercingly, and economically, drawn the scenes of his special civilization--so strangely like ours -- than did George Grosz."

作者對流傳已久的兒童視覺再現發展的看法提出質疑。傳統的取向在所謂的缺陷概念下，將兒童發展視為是有缺陷的；亦即孩童從較早的「原始」階段，進展到「較高層次」的階段，直到他們達到「視覺寫實」的終點為止。 
作者解釋了不同的視覺表現發展的模式。新模式將兒童所運用的再現方式，界定為是他們本身的意圖、動機和優先考量的後果，而非以成人的標準來評量兒童所做的努力。 
本書並非僅為心理學理論、藝術及其歷史或詮釋的專家所撰寫。這是一本幼兒教育者、接觸幼兒的其他專業人員、父母親，以及幼教學生和教師必備的書籍。"

英國全才藝評巨匠 ── 約翰‧伯格 爐火純青奇想傑作 
圖文雙重奏 素描沉思錄 
「我們畫畫的人，不僅想創作一些看得見的東西讓別人觀察，也希望能附帶一些看不見的東西，陪著它走向無法預料的終點。素描是一種探索的形式。而人類最初之所以產生素描的衝動，是因為人類需要尋找、需要測定位置、需要安置事物、需要安置自己。」── 約翰‧伯格 
班托（Bento）是十七世紀哲學家斯賓諾莎的小名。斯賓諾莎極度迷戀光學，亦喜作畫，據說他當年曾隨身攜帶一本素描簿，畫下眼前所見事物。但在他離世後所保留的書信、手稿、筆記中，卻遍尋不著傳說的素描簿。持續關注繪畫的伯格，多年來始終對這本畫冊充滿好奇，經常想像其中繪寫之物，欲以斯賓諾莎之眼觀凝物事，重探斯人話語及其令人驚嘆的哲學命題。 
有一回，伯格因緣際會得到一本無主素描簿，他認為，那就是「班托的素描簿」！靈光大發的伯格，攤開畫冊走筆塗抹，臆想並仿繪當年哲學家可能創作的篇章。在以目光觀視提問的交流動作中，伯格化心入神，蛻成班托替身，再現想像擬仿藝術的神奇瞬間。 
全書收錄六十餘幅伯格素描，往復穿插斯賓諾莎《知性改進論》及《倫理學》兩書中的摘錄片段，呼應內文圖像。文字提挈了作者落筆時的心念意圖與沉思軌跡，精妙展示藝術引導人們凝視世界的無限可能。伯格親身示範，將以往有關注視、藝術、美學方面之觀念再度整合鋪引，精采呈現於此書，成就這部高貴心靈隔空唱和的創意之作。"

國際時尚插畫家，畫下巴黎最時髦迷人的生活風貌
不必置身巴黎，也能珍藏最Fabulous的巴黎氛圍！

「巴黎永遠屬於我們。」

巴黎，光之城，浪漫、懷舊和璀璨的一切化身。
國際時尚圈極具盛名的插畫家Jason Brooks在這本書中，
透過他細緻俐落的筆觸，畫出巴黎的活潑、浪漫、文藝與時尚風貌。

「在巴黎，人人想當演員，沒人滿足於當觀眾。」

形形色色的演員走上巴黎街道這座大舞台，多變、細緻、優雅、古怪。
西蒙波娃、葛楚史坦、碧姬芭杜或海明威；香奈兒、迪奧、紀凡希和路易‧威登，
時間改變，唯獨艾菲爾鐵塔不變。
就像巴黎，總有更多的什麼等著你去發掘…… 

「巴黎不僅僅只是建立標竿，她創造潮流。」

這是一本圖文旅誌，一本旅遊指南，一本時尚插畫集，更是一名藝術家心中異想天開的美麗巴黎。從建築到街道、咖啡館，從時裝、藝術以至夜景，這本書匯集了關於巴黎的繪畫、拼貼、筆記和素描，帶領我們遊歷光鮮亮麗的時尚、美食、藝術設計及巴黎人的熱情。珍藏對這美麗城市的感應，但願它引領你走上屬於自己的美妙旅程……

一次時尚優雅的巴黎之旅：

場景一、建築街道探奇
巴黎的建築別有一份優雅與凝斂，彷彿訴說著浪漫情事。店家招牌上優雅的斜體字，陽台的線條向上延伸到鍍鋅屋頂，親近巴黎上方珠光色天空的閣樓窗戶。別緻的建築夾岸羅列，從聳現於樹梢的巴黎大皇宮玻璃穹頂，到狀如華麗結婚蛋糕的聖心堂，咖啡廳和地鐵入口的設計，也好似為了讓人短暫幽會或發怔幻想。往西望去，艾菲爾鐵塔的熟悉形影清晰可見……

場景二、咖啡館懷舊
巴黎的咖啡館好比時空膠囊，在那裡，笑聲、菸霧和談話被圈鎖在大理石櫃台、曲木椅和瓷磚地板之間：穿戴整潔的侍者、紙桌巾上開口朝上的玻璃杯、寫在黑板上的菜單、男人女人以及鹽瓶和胡椒罐還有掛著蕾絲窗簾的玻璃上左右顛倒的老式燙金字樣，彷彿始終沒改變過，在巴黎咖啡館坐下來，享用晨間的清咖啡和可頌，同時看著周遭的城市慢慢甦醒，可說是人生一大樂事……

場景三、時尚藝術風華
在巴黎，外表很重要，不管呈現的形式是時髦的迎合，抑或搶眼的創新。巴黎時尚引領全世界人的穿著，風衣、墨鏡、皮衣，在巴黎，各種配件，是彰顯個性和個人風格的一種方式。藝術每個領域的經典之作，始終在巴黎被創造出來：美妙的奧賽美術館主展覽廳，塞尚、羅特列克、竇加的雕塑、杜飛的天花板壁畫，藝術是非常巴黎式的一種迷戀……"

9781529411409,"Who was ""the first speaker"" and what was their first message? An erudite, tightly woven and beautifully written account of one of humanity's greatest mysteries - the origins of language. Drawing on evidence from many fields, including archaeology, anthropology, neurology and linguistics, Sverker Johansson weaves these disparate threads together to show how our human ancestors evolved into language users. The Dawn of Language provides a fascinating survey of how grammar came into being and the differences or similarities between languages spoken around the world, before exploring how language eventually emerged in the very remote human past. Our intellectual and physiological changes through the process of evolution both have a bearing on our ability to acquire language. But to what extent is the evolution of language dependent on genes, or on environment? How has language evolved further, and how is it changing now, in the process of globalisation? And which aspects of language ensure that robots are not yet intelligent enough to reconstruct how language has evolved? Johansson's far-reaching, authoritative and research-based approach to language is brought to life through dozens of astonishing examples, both human and animal, in a fascinatingly erudite and entertaining volume for anyone who has ever contemplated not just why we speak the way we do, but why we speak at all."

Twelve eye-opening, mind-expanding, funny and provocative essays on the implications of artificial intelligence for the way we live and the way we love - from Sunday Times-bestselling author Jeanette Winterson. An original, and entertaining new book from Jeanette Winterson, drawing on her years of thinking about and reading about Artificial Intelligence in its bewildering manifestations. She looks to history, religion, myth, literature, the politics of race and gender, and of course, computing science, to help us understand the radical changes to the way we live and love that are happening now. When we create non-biological life-forms, will we do so in our image? Or will we accept the once-in-a-species opportunity to remake ourselves in their image? What do love, caring, sex, and attachment look like when humans form connections with non-human helpers teachers, sex-workers, and companions? And what will happen to our deep-rooted assumptions about gender? Will the physical body that is our home soon be enhanced by biological and neural implants, keeping us fitter, younger, and connected? Is it time to join Elon Musk and leave Planet Earth? With wit, compassion and curiosity, Winterson tackles AI's most interesting talking points, from the algorithms that data-dossier your whole life, to the weirdness of backing up your brain."

9781633451261,"Although he is most often celebrated as a painter, Paul Cézanne’s extraordinary vision was fuelled by his experiments on paper. In pencil and watercolour, on individual sheets and across the pages of sketchbooks, the artist described form through multiple probing lines; realized compositions through repetitions and transformations; and conjured kaleidoscopic colour through laborious layering of watercolour. It is in these material realities of drawing where we see Cézanne at his most modern: embracing the unfinished, making process visible, and actively inviting the viewer to participate in the act of perception. To date, exhibitions devoted to Cézanne have tended to focus on a single genre, a specific theme, or an isolated moment within the artist’s oeuvre. Published to accompany an exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art, this is the first major effort to unite drawings from across Cézanne’s entire career, tracing the development of his practice on paper, exploring working methods that transcend subject, and devoting research to conservation as well as curatorial fronts."

Eventually the door is unlocked to a mystery that haunts Wachter's youngest son, who continues to believe his father was a good man - what happened to Otto Wachter while he was preparing to travel to Argentina on the 'ratline', assisted by a Vatican bishop, and what was the explanation for his sudden and unexpected death?"
9781509540082,"In this post-apocalyptic rollercoaster ride, philosopher Srećko Horvat invites us to explore the Apocalypse in terms of ‘revelation’ (rather than as the ‘end’ itself). He argues that the only way to prevent the end – i.e., extinction – is to engage in a close reading of various interconnected threats, such as climate crisis, the nuclear age and the ongoing pandemic. Drawing on the work of neglected philosopher Günther Anders, this book outlines a philosophical approach to deal with what Horvat, borrowing a term from climate science and giving it a theological twist, calls ‘eschatological tipping points’. These are no longer just the nuclear age or climate crisis, but their collision, conjoined with various other major threats – not only pandemics, but also the viruses of capitalism and fascism. In his investigation of the future of places such as Chernobyl, the Mediterranean and the Marshall Islands, as well as many others affected by COVID-19, Horvat contends that the ‘revelation’ appears simple and unprecedented: the alternatives are no longer socialism or barbarism – our only alternatives today are a radical reinvention of the world, or mass extinction.After the Apocalypse is an urgent call not only to mourn tomorrow’s dead today but to struggle for our future while we can."

That question caught Harvard Business School professor Tom Eisenmann by surprise when he realized he couldn’t answer it.So he launched a multiyear research project to find out. In Why Startups Fail, Eisenmann reveals his findings: six distinct patterns that account for the vast majority of startup failures.Bad Bedfellows. Startup success is thought to rest largely on the founder’s talents and instincts. But the wrong team, investors, or partners can sink a venture just as quickly.False Starts. In following the oft-cited advice to “fail fast” and to “launch before you’re ready,” founders risk wasting time and capital on the wrong solutions.False Promises.

9780062979971,"鋼鐵人馬斯克，以及他在SpaceX草創初期的絕望日子The dramatic inside story of the first four historic flights that launched SpaceX—and Elon Musk—from a shaky startup into the world’s leading edge rocket company.  In 2006, SpaceX—a brand-new venture with fewer than 200 employees—rolled its first, single-engine rocket onto a launch pad at Kwajalein Atoll. After a groundbreaking launch from the middle of the Pacific Ocean, the Falcon 1 rocket designed by Elon Musk’s engineers rose in the air for approximately thirty seconds. Then, its engine flamed out, and the rocket crashed back into the ocean.  In 2007, SpaceX undertook a second launch. This time, the rocket rose far into space, but just before reaching orbit it spun out of control. Confident of success in 2008, Musk and his team launched their third rocket with several paying customers. The first stage executed perfectly, but instead of falling away, it thudded into the second stage. Another failure. Elon Musk had only budgeted for three attempts when he founded SpaceX. Out of money and with a single Falcon 1 rocket left in its factory, SpaceX decided to try one last, dramatic launch. Over eight weeks, engineers worked furiously to prepare this final rocket. The fate of Musk’s venture mirrored the trajectory of this slender, single-engine rocket aimed toward the skies. If it crashed and burned, so would SpaceX. In September 2008, SpaceX’s last chance for success lifted off . . . and accelerated like a dream, soaring into orbit flawlessly. That success would launch a miraculous decade for the company, in which SpaceX grew from building a single-engine rocket to one with a staggering 27 engines; created two different spacecraft, and mastered reusable-rocket descents using mobile drone ships on the open seas. It marked a level of production and achievement that has not been seen since the space race of the 1960s. But these achievements would not have been possible without SpaceX’s first four flight tests. Drawing on unparalleled access and exclusive interviews with dozens of former and current employees—engineers, designers, mechanics, and executives, including Elon Musk—Eric Berger tells the complete story of this foundational generation that transformed SpaceX into the world’s leading space company. Liftoff includes more than a dozen photographs."
9781910807439,"An exhibition catalogue focusing on the Ashmolean’s rarely seen reserve collection of Pre-Raphaelite art works The incredible collection demonstrates the enormous range of Pre-Raphaelite drawing techniques and media, including pencil, pen and ink, chalk, watercolour, bodycolour and metallic paints Oxford has a special place in the history of Pre-Raphaelitism. Thomas Combe (superintendent of the Clarendon Press) encouraged John Everett Millais and William Holman Hunt at a crucial early stage of their careers, and his collection became the nucleus of the Ashmolean collection of works by the Brotherhood and their associates. Two young undergraduates, William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones, saw the Combe collection and became enthusiastic converts to the movement. With Dante Gabriel Rossetti, in 1857 they undertook the decoration of the debating chamber (now the Old Library) of the Oxford Union. The group’s champion John Ruskin also studied in Oxford, where he oversaw the design of the University Museum of Natural History and established the Ruskin School of Drawing. Jane Burden, future wife of Morris and muse (probably also lover) of Rossetti, was a local girl, first spotted at the theatre in Oxford. Oxford’s key role in the movement has made it a magnet for important bequests and acquisitions, most recently of Burne-Jones’s illustrated letters and paintbrushes. The collection of watercolours and drawings includes a wide variety of appealing works, from Hunt’s first drawing on the back of a tiny envelope for The Light of the World (Keble College), to large, elaborate chalk drawings of Jane Morris by Rossetti. It is especially rich in portraits, which throw an intimate light on the friendships and love affairs of the artists, and in landscapes which reflect Ruskin’s advice to ’go to nature’. More than just an exhibition catalogue, this book is a showcase of the Ashmolean’s incredible collection, and demonstrates the enormous range of Pre-Raphaelite drawing techniques and media, including pencil, pen and ink, chalk, watercolour, bodycolour and metallic paints. It will include designs for stained glass and furniture, as well as preparatory drawings for some of the well-known paintings in the collection."

Drawing insights from anthropology, archaeology, evolutionary biology, zoology, physics, and economics, he shows that while we have evolved to find joy meaning and purpose in work, for most of human history our ancestors worked far less and thought very differently about work than we do now. He demonstrates how our contemporary culture of work has its roots in the agricultural revolution ten thousand years ago. Our sense of what it is to be human was transformed by the transition from foraging to food production, and, later, our migration to cities. Since then, our relationships with one another and with our environments, and even our sense of the passage of time, have not been the same."
9780063060395,"""A must read for serious leaders at every level."" —General Barry R. McCaffrey (Ret.) The FBI’s former head of counterintelligence reveals the Bureau’s field-tested playbook for unlocking individual and organizational excellence, illustrated through dramatic stories from his own storied career  Frank Figliuzzi was the ""Keeper of the Code,"" appointed the FBI’s Chief Inspector by then-Director Robert Mueller. Charged with overseeing sensitive internal inquiries and performance audits, he ensured each employee met the Bureau’s exacting standards. Now, drawing on his distinguished career, Figliuzzi reveals how the Bureau achieves its extraordinary track record of excellence—from the training of new recruits in ""The FBI Way"" to the Bureau’s rigorous maintenance of its standards up and down the organization.  All good codes of conduct have one common trait: they reflect the core values of an organization. Individuals, companies, schools, teams, or any group seeking to codify their rules to live by must first establish core values. Figliuzzi has condensed the Bureau’s process of preserving and protecting its values into what he calls “The Seven C’s”. If you can adapt the concepts of Code, Conservancy, Clarity, Consequences, Compassion, Credibility, and Consistency, you can instill and preserve your values against all threats, internal and external. This is how the FBI does it. Figliuzzi’s role in the FBI gave him a unique opportunity to study patterns of conduct among high-achieving, ethical individuals and draw conclusions about why, when and how good people sometimes do bad things.

She has taken her pain and grief about our sick and troubled world and alchemized it into action, advocacy, adventure, poetry, and true love.” — ELIZABETH GILBERTWake up and reclaim your one wild and precious life. New York Times bestselling author Sarah Wilson shows you how in this radical spiritual guidebook, the book we need NOW.Many of us are living with the sense that things are not right with the world and are in a state of spiritual PTSD. We have retreated, morally and psychologically; we are experiencing a crisis of disconnection—from one another, from our true values, from joy, and from life as we feel we are meant to be living it. Sarah Wilson argues that this sense of despair and disconnection is ironically what unites us—that deep down, we are all feeling that same itch for a new way of living. Drawing on science, literature, philosophy and the wisdom of some of the world’s leading experts, and her personal journey, Wilson offers a hopeful path forward to the life we love. En route, she shows us how to wake up and reconnect with life using “wild practices” that include:Hike. Embrace the “walking cure” as great minds throughout history have.Go to your edge. Do what scares you and embrace discomfort daily. #Buylesslivemore. Break the cycle of mindless consumption and get light with your life.Become a soul nerd.

From their earliest days, children of aristocrats learn how to address an earl and curtsey before a prince – while other dictates of the ton are unspoken yet universally understood. A proper duke should be imperious and aloof. A young, marriageable lady should be amiable . . . but not too amiable. Daphne Bridgerton has always failed at the latter. The fourth of eight siblings in her close-knit family, she has formed friendships with the most eligible young men in London. Everyone likes Daphne for her kindness and wit. But no one truly desires her. She is simply too deuced honest for that, too unwilling to play the romantic games that captivate gentlemen. Amiability is not a characteristic shared by Simon Basset, Duke of Hastings. Recently returned to England from abroad, he intends to shun both marriage and society – just as his callous father shunned Simon throughout his painful childhood. Yet an encounter with his best friend's sister offers another option. If Daphne agrees to a fake courtship, Simon can deter the mamas who parade their daughters before him. Daphne, meanwhile, will see her prospects and her reputation soar. The plan works like a charm-at first. But amid the glittering, gossipy, cut-throat world of London's elite, there is only one certainty: love ignores every rule . . ."

9780500022672,"Sculpture is the universal art. It has been practised by every culture throughout the world and stretches back into the distant past. The first surviving shaped stones may even predate the advent of language. The drive to form stone, clay, wood and metal into shapes evidently runs deep in our psyche and biology. This links the question 'What is sculpture?' to the question 'What is humanity?' In this wide-ranging book, two complementary voices – one belonging to an artist who looks to Asian and Buddhist traditions as much as to Western sculptural history, the other to a critic and historian – consider how sculpture has been central to the evolution of our potential for thinking and feeling. Sculpture cannot be seen in isolation as an aesthetic pursuit; it is related to humankind’s compelling urge to make its mark on the landscape, to build, make pictures, practise religion and develop philosophical thought. Drawing on examples from thousands of years BCE to now, and from around the globe, the authors treat sculpture as a transnational art form with its own compelling history. They take into account materials and techniques, and consider overarching themes such as space, light and darkness. Above all, they discuss their view of sculpture as a form of physical thinking capable of altering the way people feel and of inviting them to look at sculpture they encounter and more broadly the world around them in a completely different way."

He began painting in his youth in Italy before moving to Paris in 1906, during the height of the avant-garde movement. Influenced by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Paul Cézanne, Modigliani developed his own unique, uncharacterizable style. His nudes upended traditions at the time due to their immodesty, candid sexuality, and ability to convey the subject’s personality. Because of the works’ scandalous nature, Modigliani had very little success with his paintings while he was alive. This volume features stunning full-page illustrations of Modigliani’s works, along with information about his life, including his bohemian, over-the-top lifestyle and his untimely, tragic death. Featuring some of Modigliani’s best-known works, this book gives an insightful and comprehensive overview on the artist known for modernizing figurative painting."

If our leaders were forced to read this book, the world would be a safer place' Richard Dawkins'A beautifully reasoned book about our own unreasonableness' Robin Ince Why did revolutionary China consider the sparrow an 'animal of capitalism' - and what happened when they tried to wipe them out? With a cast of murderous popes, snake-oil salesmen and superstitious pigeons, find out why flawed logic puts us all at risk, and how critical thinking can save the world. It may seem a big claim, but knowing how to think clearly and critically has literally helped save the world. In September 1983, at the height of the Cold War, the Soviet Union's early warning system showed five US missiles heading towards the country. Stanislaw Petrov knew his duty: he was to inform Moscow that nuclear war had begun, so that they could launch an immediate and devastating response. Instead, he made a call to say the system was faulty. He'd assessed the situation and reasoned that an error was more likely than such a limited attack.  We may not have to save the planet from nuclear annihilation, of course, but our ability to think critically has never been more important. In a world where fake news, mistrust of experts, prejudice and ignorance all too often hold sway, we can all too easily be misled over issues such as vaccinations, climate change or conspiracy theories. We live in an era where access to all the knowledge in the world is at our fingertips, yet that also means misinformation and falsehoods can spread further and faster than ever before.  In The Irrational Ape, David Robert Grimes shows how we can be lured into making critical mistakes or drawing false conclusions, and how to avoid such errors. Given the power of modern science and the way that movements can unite to protest a cause via social media, we are in dangerous times. But fortunately, we can learn from our mistakes, and by critical thinking and scientific method we can discover how to apply these techniques to everything from deciding what insurance to buy to averting global disaster. This book, packed with fascinating case studies and examples, helps ensure we are ready for the modern world."

Drawing on momentous (yet dimly remembered) historical epidemics, contemporary analyses, and cutting-edge research from a range of scientific disciplines, bestselling author, physician, sociologist, and public health expert Nicholas A.

Featuring new, provocative arguments and vivid examples ranging across medicine, history, sociology, epidemiology, data science, and genetics, Apollo's Arrow envisions what happens when the great force of a deadly germ meets the enduring reality of our evolved social nature."

His goal was ambitious: to transform what would become over a hundred hours of interviews into an unprecedented portrait of Malcolm X, one that would separate fact from fiction. The result is this historic biography that conjures a never-before-seen world of its protagonist, a work whose title is inspired by a phrase Malcolm X used when he saw his Hartford followers stir with purpose, as if the dead were truly arising, to overcome the obstacles of racism. Setting Malcolm’s life not only within the Nation of Islam but against the larger backdrop of American history, the book traces the life of one of the twentieth century’s most politically relevant figures “from street criminal to devoted moralist and revolutionary.” In tracing Malcolm X’s life from his Nebraska birth in 1925 to his Harlem assassination in 1965, Payne provides searing vignettes culled from Malcolm’s Depression-era youth, describing the influence of his Garveyite parents: his father, Earl, a circuit-riding preacher who was run over by a street car in Lansing, Michigan, in 1929, and his mother, Louise, who continued to instill black pride in her children after Earl’s death. Filling each chapter with resonant drama, Payne follows Malcolm’s exploits as a petty criminal in Boston and Harlem in the 1930s and early 1940s to his religious awakening and conversion to the Nation of Islam in a Massachusetts penitentiary. With a biographer’s unwavering determination, Payne corrects the historical record and delivers extraordinary revelations―from the unmasking of the mysterious NOI founder “Fard Muhammad,” who preceded Elijah Muhammad; to a hair-rising scene, conveyed in cinematic detail, of Malcolm and Minister Jeremiah X Shabazz’s 1961 clandestine meeting with the KKK; to a minute-by-minute account of Malcolm X’s murder at the Audubon Ballroom. Introduced by Payne’s daughter and primary researcher, Tamara Payne, who, following her father’s death, heroically completed the biography, The Dead Are Arising is a penetrating and riveting work that affirms the centrality of Malcolm X to the African American freedom struggle. 32 pages of illustrations"

9781984855022,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • An intimate and revealing portrait of civil rights icon and longtime U.S. congressman John Lewis, linking his life to the painful quest for justice in America from the 1950s to the present—from the Pulitzer Prize–winning author of The Soul of America NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY THE WASHINGTON POST AND COSMOPOLITAN John Lewis, who at age twenty-five marched in Selma, Alabama, and was beaten on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, was a visionary and a man of faith. Drawing on decades of wide-ranging interviews with Lewis, Jon Meacham writes of how this great-grandson of a slave and son of an Alabama tenant farmer was inspired by the Bible and his teachers in nonviolence, Reverend James Lawson and Martin Luther King, Jr., to put his life on the line in the service of what Abraham Lincoln called “the better angels of our nature.” From an early age, Lewis learned that nonviolence was not only a tactic but a philosophy, a biblical imperative, and a transforming reality. At the age of four, Lewis, ambitious to become a minister, practiced by preaching to his family’s chickens. When his mother cooked one of the chickens, the boy refused to eat it—his first act, he wryly recalled, of nonviolent protest. Integral to Lewis’s commitment to bettering the nation was his faith in humanity and in God—and an unshakable belief in the power of hope.  Meacham calls Lewis “as important to the founding of a modern and multiethnic twentieth- and twenty-first-century America as Thomas Jefferson and James Madison and Samuel Adams were to the initial creation of the Republic itself in the eighteenth century.” A believer in the injunction that one should love one’s neighbor as oneself, Lewis was arguably a saint in our time, risking limb and life to bear witness for the powerless in the face of the powerful. In many ways he brought a still-evolving nation closer to realizing its ideals, and his story offers inspiration and illumination for Americans today who are working for social and political change."

But this well-established pathway is already beginning to collapse – life expectancy is rising, final-salary pensions are vanishing, and increasing numbers of people are juggling multiple careers. Whether you are 18, 45 or 60, you will need to do things very differently from previous generations and learn to structure your life in completely new ways. The 100-Year Life is here to help. Drawing on the unique pairing of their experience in psychology and economics, Lynda Gratton and Andrew J. Scott offer a broad-ranging analysis as well as a raft of solutions, showing how to rethink your finances, your education, your career and your relationships and create a fulfilling 100-year life. How can you fashion a career and life path that defines you and your values and creates a shifting balance between work and leisure? What are the most effective ways of boosting your physical and mental health over a longer and more dynamic lifespan? How can you make the most of your intangible assets – such as family and friends – as you build a productive, longer life? In a multiple-stage life how can you learn to make the transitions that will be so crucial and experiment with new ways of living, working and learning? Shortlisted for the FT/McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award and featuring a new preface, The 100-Year Life is a wake-up call that describes what to expect and considers the choices and options that you will face. It is also fundamentally a call to action for individuals, politicians, firms and governments and offers the clearest demonstration that a 100-year life can be a wonderful and inspiring one.	"
9780300243406,"The end of our high-growth world was underway well before COVID-19 arrived. In this powerful and timely argument, Danny Dorling demonstrates the benefits of a larger, ongoing societal slowdown Drawing from an incredibly rich trove of global data, this groundbreaking book reveals that human progress has been slowing down since the early 1970s. Danny Dorling uses compelling visualizations to illustrate how fertility rates, growth in GDP per person, and even the frequency of new social movements have all steadily declined over the last few generations. Perhaps most surprising of all is the fact that even as new technologies frequently reshape our everyday lives and are widely believed to be propelling our civilization into new and uncharted waters, the rate of technological progress is also rapidly dropping. Rather than lament this turn of events, Dorling embraces it as a moment of promise and a move toward stability, and he notes that many of the older great strides in progress that have defined recent history also brought with them widespread warfare, divided societies, and massive inequality."
9780300252675,"A short and thoughtful introduction to traditional Chinese medicine that looks beyond the conventional boundaries of Western modernism and biomedical science Traditional Chinese medicine is often viewed as mystical or superstitious, with outcomes requiring naïve faith. Judith Farquhar, drawing on her hard-won knowledge of social, intellectual, and clinical worlds in today's China, here offers a concise and nuanced treatment that addresses enduring and troublesome ontological, epistemological, and ethical questions. In this work, which is based on her 2017 Terry Lectures “Reality, Reason, and Action In and Beyond Chinese Medicine,” she considers how the modern, rationalized, and scientific field of traditional Chinese medicine constructs its very real objects (bodies, symptoms, drugs), how experts think through and sort out pathology and health (yinyang, right qi/wrong qi, stasis, flow), and how contemporary doctors act responsibly to “seek out the root” of bodily disorder. Through this refined investigation, East-West contrasts collapse, and systematic Chinese medicine, no longer a mystery or a pseudo-science, can become a philosophical ally and a rich resource for a more capacious science."

9780500204597,"Few British artists have ever achieved such a wide range of style in oil painting, watercolour, drawing and engraving as J. M. W. Turner. He had a precocious gift that was developed over a lifetime of experiment and innovation. This classic book in the World of Art series traces the artist’s career – from youthful pictureseque views and watercolours of ‘Gothic’ ruins to the romantic landscape and historical compositions of his maturity, and the astonishing art of his later years. In these late paintings Turner’s tragic sense of life is stated most profoundly and the work was unintelligible to his contemporaries – but his reputation as the greatest British painter now rests on our understanding of these as pioneering explorations of abstraction, prefiguring the art of the 20th century. Graham Reynolds weaves together the artist’s biography with sensitive criticism of his work, through all phases of his career, in this classic work – first published in 1969 – that has long served as an outstanding introduction to Turner’s life and art. It has now been revised and updated by the curator of the Turner Bequest at Tate, David Blayney Brown, to reflect recent discoveries and interpretations, and the illustrations are in full colour for the first time. It will serve as the best available study of this perennially popular artist for a new generation of readers."

9781909961654,"Nearly one hundred years after Franz Kafka's death, his works continue to intrigue and haunt us. Kafka is regarded as one of the most significant intellectuals of the nineteenth and twentieth century, and even for those who are only barely acquainted with his novels, stories, diaries, or letters, ""Kafkaesque"" has become a term synonymous with the menacing, unfathomable absurdity of modern existence and bureaucracy. While the significance of his fiction is wide-reaching, Kafka's writing remains inextricably bound up with his life and work in a particular place: Prague. It is here that the author spent every one of his forty years. Drawing from a range of documents and historical materials, this is the first book specifically dedicated to the relationship between Kafka and Prague. Klaus Wagenbach's account of Kafka's life in the city is a meticulously researched insight into the author's family background, his education and employment, his attitude toward the town of his birth, his literary influences, and his relationships with women. The result is a fascinating portrait of the twentieth century's most enigmatic writer and the city that provided him with so much inspiration. W. G. Sebald recognized that ""literary and life experience overlap"" in Kafka's works, and the same is true of this book."

How the Brain Works begins with an introduction to the brain's anatomy, showing you how to tell your motor cortex from your mirror neurons.

9780500094235,"A new, compact edition of David Hockney and Martin Gayford’s brilliantly original book, with a revised final chapter and three entirely new Hockney artworks 'I won't read a more interesting book all year ... utterly fascinating' --AN Wilson, The Sunday Times Informed and energized by a lifetime of painting, drawing and making images with cameras, David Hockney, in collaboration with the art critic Martin Gayford, explores how and why pictures have been made across the millennia. What makes marks on a flat surface interesting? How do you show movement in a still picture, and how, conversely, do films and television connect with old masters? Juxtaposing a rich variety of images – a still from a Disney cartoon with a Japanese woodblock print by Hiroshige, a scene from an Eisenstein film with a Velázquez painting – the authors cross the normal boundaries between high culture and popular entertainment, and make unexpected connections across time and media. Building on Hockney’s groundbreaking book Secret Knowledge, they argue that film, photography, painting and drawing are deeply interconnected. Insightful and thought provoking, A History of Pictures is an important contribution to our appreciation of how we represent our reality. This new edition has a revised final chapter with some of Hockney’s latest works, including the stained-glass window in Westminster Abbey."
4050538517507,"Half a century ago, vast numbers of British working-class youths adopted a style that reflected both their attitude and tastes. Dubbed by the country's media as 'skinhead', the look starkly contrasted with that of the country's largely middle-class 'hippy' population, drawing heavily on the smart, practical and stylish fashions introduced to the UK by the Windrush generation. And the Caribbean influence was even more evident in the music that provided the soundtrack to the skinhead scene: reggae. To finally set the record straight about this greatly mis-understood sub-culture, celebrated writers, Paul 'Smiler' Anderson and Mark Baxter have penned a brand new book, 'Scorcha! Skins, Suedes and style from the Streets - 1967 to 1973'. In addition, the pair have also compiled a companion 7"" vinyl box set of the same title, comprising ten 45s, each featuring a pair of reggae classics favoured by first generation skinhead record buyers. Pressed on high quality vinyl and presented in sturdy reproduction Trojan-branded sleeves, the singles are accompanied by an insert featuring a fascinating essay on the music and those on the scene by the book's co-author, Paul Anderson. - Disc 1 -1 Skinhead Girl - By Symarip2 Jombo Jet (Jumbo Jet) - By Trojan Records- Disc 2 -1 C.N.

9780241366462,"Humanity's greatest feat is our incredible ability to learn. Even in their first year, infants acquire language, visual and social knowledge at a rate that surpasses the best supercomputers. But how, exactly, do our brains learn? In How We Learn, leading neuroscientist Stanislas Dehaene delves into the psychological, neuronal, synaptic and molecular mechanisms of learning. Drawing on case studies of children who learned despite huge difficulty and trauma, he explains why youth is such a sensitive period, during which brain plasticity is maximal, but also assures us that our abilities continue into adulthood. We can all enhance our learning and memory at any age and 'learn to learn' by taking maximal advantage of the four pillars of the brain's learning algorithm: attention, active engagement, error feedback and consolidation. The human brain is an extraordinary machine. Its ability to process information and adapt to circumstances by reprogramming itself is unparalleled, and it remains the best source of inspiration for recent developments in artificial intelligence. How We Learn finds the boundary of computer science, neurobiology, cognitive psychology and education to explain how learning really works and how to make the best use of the brain's learning algorithms - and even improve them - in our schools and universities as well as in everyday life."

Detailed line drawings superimposed over photographs reveal the links between the body's appearance and its construction. Six drawing classes show how to observe different parts of the body and give expert guidance on how to draw them. Inspirational master classes on famous works, ranging from a Michelangelo study to a Degas painting, show how artists have depicted the human body over the centuries. Each master class includes a photograph of a model holding the same pose as in the painting, to highlight details of anatomy and show how the artist has interpreted them. Understanding anatomy is the key to drawing the human body successfully.

Drawing on diverse theological, philosophical, and anthropological insights, it offers fresh ways to evaluate food production and consumption practices as they are being worked out in today's industrial food economy. Unlike books that focus primarily on vegetarianism and hunger-related concerns, this book broadens the scope of consideration to include the sacramental character of eating, the deep significance of hospitality, the meaning of death and sacrifice, the Eucharist as the place of inspiration and orientation, the importance of saying grace, and the possibility of eating in heaven. Throughout, eating is presented as a way of enacting fidelity between persons, between people and fellow creatures, and between people and Earth. Food and Faith demonstrates that eating is of profound economic, moral, and spiritual significance. Revised throughout, this edition includes a new introduction and two chapters, as well as updated bibliography. The additions add significantly to the core idea of creaturely membership and hospitality through discussion of the microbiome revolution in science, and the daunting challenge of the Anthropocene."

9780367370831,"This fascinating new book examines diversity in moral judgements, drawing on recent work in social, personality, and evolutionary psychology, reviewing the factors that influence the moral judgments people make.  Why do reasonable people so often disagree when drawing distinctions between what is morally right and wrong? Even when individuals agree in their moral pronouncements, they may employ different standards, different comparative processes, or entirely disparate criteria in their judgments. Examining the sources of this variety, the author expertly explores morality using ethics position theory, alongside other theoretical perspectives in moral psychology, and shows how it can relate to contemporary social issues from abortion to premarital sex to human rights. Also featuring a chapter on applied contexts, using the theory of ethics positions to gain insights into the moral choices and actions of individuals, groups, and organizations in educational, research, political, medical, and business settings, the book offers answers that apply across individuals, communities, and cultures. Investigating the relationship between people’s personal moral philosophies and their ethical thoughts, emotions, and actions, this is fascinating reading for students and academics from psychology and philosophy and anyone interested in morality and ethics."

9781944929091,"Though best known as a painter of scrupulous hard-edge abstractions, Ellsworth Kelly (1923–2015) saw drawing plants as playing a central role in his art. “The drawings from plant life seem to be the bridge to the way of seeing that brought about the paintings in 1949,” Kelly wrote in 1969. That way of seeing, he said, was “the basis for all my later work.” The rigorous and exacting observation of the natural world that Kelly used to make his plant drawings―a practice he continued through his whole career―helped him to refine his distinctly direct brand of minimal abstraction.  First published in 2017 and quickly going out of print, Ellsworth Kelly: Plant Drawings features more than 30 drawings made by Kelly between 1949 and 2008. Kelly made these gorgeously economical line drawings from life, sometimes barely lifting the pencil as he translated each plant’s contours to paper. Focusing on direct visual impression―“nothing is changed or added,” as he put it―Kelly used the natural forms of the plants to explore some of his painterly fixations, like the effects of volume, negative space and overlapping planes. Despite the immediacy of their execution and their representational content, the most striking surprise of Kelly’s plant drawings is how much they share with his abstract paintings and sculptures."

9781912339457,"Artists drawing or painting their mother has become iconic in art history-from Whistler through Freud, Cezanne, Hockney, Ingres, Gauguin or Durer, whose brutally honest portraits of his mother insisted that ’Even the smallest wrinkles and veins must not be ignored’. Paul Graham’s first major body of work since 2014’s Does Yellow Run Forever? contains portraits of his elderly mother sitting in her chair in a retirement community in England. Graham’s camera hardly moves, with his mother asleep, eyes closed, in almost every image. Our palette is the gentle tones of old age-a flowered blouse, a pink or lavender cardigan-the light comes from a single daylight window, soft, natural and constant. With little attempt to photographically ’entertain’ us, we begin to notice subtle shifts of carefully chosen focus, from one eye to another, to a loose thread on a button or a stray wisp of hair. Frozen in time, the fraying of life is expressed through modest details. Powerful emotional resonance arrives through tender observation. Mortality and the slow unraveling of late old age is the principal subject here, but there is also a duality at the core of these images: as we teeter between life and death, child and parent reverse roles-the watched-over becomes the watcher, the created becomes the creator."

9781138608979,"Facebook, the Media and Democracy examines Facebook Inc. and the impact that it has had and continues to have on media and democracy around the world. Drawing on interviews with Facebook users of different kinds and dialogue with politicians, regulators, civil society and media commentators, as well as detailed documentary scrutiny of legislative and regulatory proposals and Facebook's corporate statements, the book presents a comprehensive but clear overview of the current debate around Facebook and the global debate on the regulation of social media in the era of 'surveillance capitalism.' Chapters examine the business and growing institutional power of Facebook as it has unfolded over the fifteen years since its creation, the benefits and meanings that it has provided for its users, its disruptive challenge to the contemporary media environment, its shaping of conversations, and the emerging calls for its further regulation. The book considers Facebook's alleged role in the rise of democratic movements around the world as well as its suggested role in the election of Donald Trump and the UK vote to leave the European Union. This book argues that Facebook, in some shape or form, is likely to be with us into the foreseeable future and that how we address the societal challenges that it provokes, and the economic system that underpins it, will define how human societies demonstrate their capacity to protect and enhance democracy and ensure that no corporation can set itself above democratic institutions. This is an important research volume for academics and researchers in the areas of media studies, communications, social media and political science."

9783945852330,"Surrealism's enduring impact on furniture design, fashion, advertising and beyond One of the most influential art movements of the 20th century, surrealism expanded our artistic and quotidian reality by drawing upon myths, dreams and the subconscious as sources of artistic inspiration. The movement began in literature and art, but by the 1930s it was beginning to have an impact on design―an influence that continues to this day. The fascination was often mutual: surrealism opened design up to the realm of dreams, and design could introduce surrealism to the wider world. “I try to create fantastic things, magical things, things like in a dream,” Salvador Dalí said of his work. “The world needs more fantasy.” Designers in fashion, furniture design, advertising, theater, film and architecture took up the call.Objects of Desire: Surrealism and Design is the first book to document this fascinating conversation. The publication includes numerous essays and a comprehensive selection of images which trace the reciprocal exchanges between surrealism and design by juxtaposing exemplary artworks and design objects.Among the artists and designers featured in this volume are Gae Aulenti, Louise Bourgeois, Umberto and Fernando Campana, Achille Castiglioni, Giorgio de Chirico, Le Corbusier, Salvador Dalí, Marcel Duchamp, Frederick Kiesler, René Magritte, Carlo Mollino, Meret Oppenheim, Jerszy Seymour, and many others. Historical texts and short commentaries by contemporary designers round out the publication, putting the extravagant objects in context. In-depth yet appropriately fantastical, Objects of Desire makes one thing abundantly clear: form does not always follow function in design―it can also follow our obsessions, fantasies and hidden desires."

9781108712491,"The sent-down youth movement, a Maoist project that relocated urban youth to remote rural areas for 're-education', is often viewed as a defining feature of China's Cultural Revolution and emblematic of the intense suffering and hardship of the period. Drawing on rich archival research focused on Shanghai's youth in village settlements in remote regions, this history of the movement pays particular attention to how it was informed by and affected the critical issue of urban-rural relations in the People's Republic of China. It highlights divisions, as well as connections, created by the movement, particularly the conflicts and collaborations between urban and rural officials. Instead of chronicling a story of victims of a monolithic state, Honig and Zhao show how participants in the movement - the sent-down youth, their parents, and local government officials - disregarded, circumvented, and manipulated state policy, ultimately undermining a decade-long Maoist project."
9780500295212,"Drawing was central to Cézanne's indefatigable search for solutions to the problems posed by the depiction of reality. Many of his watercolours are equal to his paintings, and he himself made no real distinction between painting and drawing. This book's six chapters are arranged thematically covering the whole range of Cézanne's œuvre: works after the Old Masters such as Michelangelo and Rubens; his period as one of the Impressionists; his exploration of both portraiture and the human figure, including the magnificent bathers; his interaction with landscape, particularly in his native Provence and the dominating form of Mont Sainte-Victoire; and finally the magisterial still lifes. In the Introduction, as well as throughout the book, Lloyd sets the drawings and watercolours in the context of Cézanne's life and overall artistic development. The result is a greater understanding of the process that led to some of the most absorbing art ever produced."

To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Louvre pyramid, Jean-Michel Othoniel was invited to create a work relating the importance of flowers in the Museum's eight art departments. The artist photographed the floral wealth concealed in the masterpieces of the Museum's painting, drawing, sculpture, embroidery and enamel collections. Using this, Othoniel composes his own original herbarium, accompanied with notes on the secret language of flowers and their symbolism in the history of art. Among the seventy details of flowers, you will find the thistle in Dürer's selfportrait, the poppy in the Paros funerary stele, the apple sitting on a stool in The Lock by Fragonard, or the peony attached to the unfastened blouse of the young woman in Greuze's Broken Pitcher. The work also introduces us to lesser-known details in works, offering a magnificent treasure hunt for visitors of the museum. Amid this vast prairie spangled with symbolic flowers, the artist asks this question: If there could be only one, which would be the Louvre's flower? A question to which the artist himself offers his own response."

9781908970466,"An exquisite facsimile edition of a turn-of-the-century illustrated children’s ABC of animals.This charming volume is a facsimile of a children’s ABC of animals first published in 1899. Commissioned by Glasgow publisher Blackie & Son, it contains a short description and a full-page grisaille drawing for each animal, beginning with A for armadillo and ending with Z for zebra, with vignettes accompanying each letter of the alphabet. It was the first publication by Carton Moore Park, who specialized in animal subjects, and whose artistic style was strongly influenced by Japonisme. The quirky drawings, with the modern-looking crops and close-up perspective, made the book stand out from all other alphabets of the day. The plate of the hippopotamus, for example, conveys the great bulk of the animal by forcing it up against the frame, while the image of the bat has flying almost in the reader’s face. The picture of the leopard is one of several plates that reveal Moore Park’s interest in Japanese art. When the book was published, contemporary critics acclaimed the artist’s strong handling and accurate anatomical knowledge, as well as his profound appreciation of the habits and movements of the animals depicted and his close sympathy with his subjects. One wrote that, ‘It is certainly the best book of the kind we have ever seen.’ A hundred and twenty years after it was first published, this exquisite rediscovered book – very much of its moment but modern in spirit – will enchant and educate a new generation of children.Animals included: A for Armadillo • B for Bear • C for Cat • D for Dromedary • E for Elephant • F for Fox • G for Guinea-Pig • H for Hippopotamus • I for Ibex • J for Jackal • K for Kangaroo • L for Leopard • M for Mice • N for Nylghau • O for Otter • P for Porcupine • Q for Quagga • R for Rabbit • S for Sheep • T for Tiger • U for Unicorn • V for Vampire • W for Weasel • X for two Extraordinary Animals (Anteater and Ornithorynchus) • Y for Yak • Z for Zebra"

Recorded with largely homemade and/or highly customized equipment, Tuttle's fourth and latest solo offering Dream Road features a truly new and unique take on the tones and textures of classic American rock and pop music. Here familiar elements like the jangly acoustic guitar are pushed to the limit and return as an unbreachable wall of swirling harmonic rhythm,as drum sounds are isolated to a level of dryness that threaten to nearly encroach your listening environment. Country tinged lead guitars, strings and horns all weave in and out of songs without ever placing the discernible stamp of any particular genre on the infectious melodies found throughout this record. Over the past 7years Tuttle's live show (which on numerous occasions has taken him and his ever changing live band across the US and Europe) has become notorious for it's high energy improvisations and extended guitar solos."

9781588396686,"Drawing from Susan Sontag’s seminal essay, this striking volume explores the meaning of camp and its expression in fashion from its origins to todayAlthough an elusive concept, “camp” can be found in most forms of artistic expression, revealing itself through an aesthetic of deliberate stylization. Fashion is one of the most overt and enduring conduits of the camp aesthetic. As a site for the playful dynamics between high art and popular culture, fashion both embraces and expresses such camp modes of enactment as irony, humor, parody, pastiche, artifice, theatricality, and exaggeration. Drawing from Susan Sontag’s seminal essay “Notes on Camp,” the book explores how fashion designers have used their métier as a vehicle to engage with the camp aesthetic in compelling, humorous, and sometimes incongruous ways. As a sartorial manifestation of the camp sensibility, this thought-provoking publication contributes new theoretical and conceptual insights into the camp canon through texts and images. Stunning new photography by Johnny Dufort highlights works by such fashion designers as Virgil Abloh, Thom Browne, Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, John Galliano, Jean Paul Gaultier, Marc Jacobs, Karl Lagerfeld, Alessandro Michele, Franco Moschino, Miuccia Prada, Richard Quinn, Yves Saint Laurent, Elsa Schiaparelli, Jeremy Scott, Anna Sui, Gianni Versace, and Vivienne Westwood."

Drawing from the New York Public Library’s archives, The Stonewall Reader is a collection of first accounts, diaries, periodic literature, and articles from LGBTQ magazines and newspapers that documented both the years leading up to and the years following the riots. Most importantly the anthology spotlights both iconic activists who were pivotal in the movement, such as Sylvia Rivera, co-founder of Street Transvestites Action Revolutionaries (STAR), as well as forgotten figures like Ernestine Eckstein, one of the few out, African American, lesbian activists in the 1960s. The anthology focuses on the events of 1969, the five years before, and the five years after.

9781847497956,"Between 1892 and 1895, Oscar Wilde's drawing-room comedies Lady Windermere's Fan, A Woman of No Importance, An Ideal Husband and The Importance of Being Earnest made his name as a playwright who fearlessly mocked the hypocrisy and snobbery of Victorian society and took gleeful delight in appearing to trivialize its most sacred institutions. With its premiere on Valentine's Day 1895, The Importance of Being Earnest – a hilarious comedy of mistaken identities and coruscating language – was a phenomenal success, but its run was cut short prematurely by Wilde's court case and subsequent incarceration, and the play was not published until 1899, after Wilde had been released from prison.Also including the powerful Salome, originally written in French and banned by the British censor, this collection displays Wilde at his provocative and witty best, and demonstrates why he was a playwright who delighted audiences and infuriated critics in equal measure."

Mountains, rivers, rocks, trees, animals, and human beings are all modalities of energymatter, symbolizing that the creative transformation of the Tao [Dao] is forever present."" Similar expressions of this unity are common to the three major philosophical and religious traditions of Daoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism that form the foundation of the Chinese belief system.Heaven and Earth in Chinese Art includes over eighty artworks of outstanding beauty covering paintings, calligraphy, illustrated books, bronzes, ceramics, and jade and wood carvings.The National Palace Museum in Taipei holds one of the finest selections of Chinese art in the world.

9780262536646,"A concise, accessible, and engaging guide for students and practitioners of sociology. In Forms of Life, Harry Collins offers an introduction to social science methodology, drawing on his forty-plus years of conducting high-profile sociological research. In this concise, accessible, and engaging book, Collins explains not only how to do sociology (the method) but also how to think about sociology (the meaning). For example, he describes the three activities that are the foundations of sociological method (immersing oneself in a society; estranging oneself from that society; and explaining what has been discovered to those who have not been immersed) and goes on to consider broader questions of the meaning of science in relation to social science and the scientific authority of ""subjective"" methods. He explains that sociology is the study of social collectivities (often overlapping, subdividable, and embedded), and cites Wittgenstein's notion of ""forms of life"" in his definition of collectivity. Collins covers such methodological topics as participant comprehension; interview-based fieldwork (""expect plans to fail""); interactional expertise; alternation and methodological relativism; tangible and inferential experiments; tribalism and emotional loyalty; and how to communicate your findings. Finally, he offers recommendations for ""saving the science of sociology,"" considering, among other things, sociology's identity as a discipline and the perils of both ""groupism"" and being too afraid of it. Appendixes offer a code of conduct for interviews; a list of his relevant publications; and an account, in Q&A form, of a disastrous day in the life of a sociologist doing fieldwork."
9780520305632,"In this unprecedented view from the trenches, prosecutor turned champion for the innocent Mark Godsey takes us inside the frailties of the human mind as they unfold in real-world wrongful convictions. Drawing upon stories from his own career, Godsey shares how innate psychological flaws in judges, police, lawyers, and juries coupled with a “tough on crime” environment can cause investigations to go awry, leading to the convictions of innocent people. In Blind Injustice, Godsey explores distinct psychological human weaknesses inherent in the criminal justice system—confirmation bias, memory malleability, cognitive dissonance, bureaucratic denial, dehumanization, and others—and illustrates each with stories from his time as a hard-nosed prosecutor and then as an attorney for the Ohio Innocence Project.  He also lays bare the criminal justice system’s internal political pressures. How does the fact that judges, sheriffs, and prosecutors are elected officials influence how they view cases? How can defense attorneys support clients when many are overworked and underpaid? And how do juries overcome bias leading them to believe that police and expert witnesses know more than they do about what evidence means?  This book sheds a harsh light on the unintentional yet routine injustices committed by those charged with upholding justice. Yet in the end, Godsey recommends structural, procedural, and attitudinal changes aimed at restoring justice to the criminal justice system."

Drawing on his most ambitious philosophical predecessors - Leibniz, Kant, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Lacan, Deleuze – Badiou ends this important later work with an impassioned call to 'live for an Idea'."

She outlines the tension between China’s embrace of the free market and a regime dependent on a socialist imprimatur. She also offers a genealogy of China’s transformation from a source of revolutionary power into a fountainhead of globalized modernity. This narrative, Dai contends, leaves little hope of moving from the capitalist degradation of the present into a radical future that might offer a more socially just world."

9781541736122,"In 1918, the Italian-Americans of New York, the Yupik of Alaska and the Persians of Mashed had almost nothing in common except for a virus--one that triggered the worst pandemic of modern times and had a decisive effect on the history of the twentieth century. The Spanish flu of 1918-1920 was one of the greatest human disasters of all time. It infected a third of the people on Earth--from the poorest immigrants of New York City to the king of Spain, Franz Kafka, Mahatma Gandhi and Woodrow Wilson. But despite a death toll of between 50 and 100 million people, it exists in our memory as an afterthought to World War I. In this gripping narrative history, Laura Spinney traces the overlooked pandemic to reveal how the virus travelled across the globe, exposing mankind's vulnerability and putting our ingenuity to the test. As socially significant as both world wars, the Spanish flu dramatically disrupted--and often permanently altered--global politics, race relations and family structures, while spurring innovation in medicine, religion and the arts. It was partly responsible, Spinney argues, for pushing India to independence, South Africa to apartheid and Switzerland to the brink of civil war. It also created the true ""lost generation."" Drawing on the latest research in history, virology, epidemiology, psychology and economics, Pale Rider masterfully recounts the little-known catastrophe that forever changed humanity."

9780811226059,"WINNER OF THE 2019 PULITZER PRIZE IN POETRYLONGLISTED FOR THE 2018 NATIONAL BOOK AWARDPublishers Weekly Best Poetry Book of 2018Forrest Gander’s first book of poems since his Pulitzer finalist Core Samples from the World: a startling look through loss, grief, and regret into the exquisite nature of intimacy Drawing from his experience as a translator, Forrest Gander includes in the first, powerfully elegiac section a version of a poem by the Spanish mystical poet St. John of the Cross. He continues with a long multilingual poem examining the syncretic geological and cultural history of the U.S. border with Mexico. The poems of the third section―a moving transcription of Gander’s efforts to address his mother dying of Alzheimer’s―rise from the page like hymns, transforming slowly from reverence to revelation. Gander has been called one of our most formally restless poets, and these new poems express a characteristically tensile energy and, as one critic noted, “the most eclectic diction since Hart Crane.”"
9781503606067,"Identity has become a central feature of national conversations: identity politics and identity crises are the order of the day. We celebrate identity when it comes to personal freedom and group membership, and we fear the power of identity when it comes to discrimination, bias, and hate crimes. Drawing on Isaiah Berlin's famous distinction between positive and negative liberty, Theodor Adorno and the Century of Negative Identity argues for the necessity of acknowledging a dialectic within the identity concept. Exploring the intellectual history of identity as a social idea, Eric Oberle shows the philosophical importance of identity's origins in American exile from Hitler's fascism. Positive identity was first proposed by Frankfurt School member Erich Fromm, while negative identity was almost immediately put forth as a counter-concept by Fromm's colleague, Theodor Adorno. Oberle explains why, in the context of the racism, authoritarianism, and the hard-right agitation of the 1940s, the invention of a positive concept of identity required a theory of negative identity. This history in turn reveals how autonomy and objectivity can be recovered within a modern identity structured by domination, alterity, ontologized conflict, and victim blaming."
9780316416245,"Drawing on ten years of experience working with more than 10,000 executives from companies around the globe, Nick Craig takes you on a revelatory journey to understand your purpose, find clarity and focus, and lead with inspiration.When uncovered, purpose becomes our most fundamental guiding principle. Explaining where true purpose lies and demystifying where it doesn't, Craig offers the methods through which anyone can find their purpose. He identifies three pathways that will assess where you are with your purpose and where you should be going.Illustrated by case studies of leaders from all walks of life and industries, Craig shares their unique stories to show how top leaders are energized by their purpose, finding in it the confidence they need to properly evaluate high-stakes decisions and take the optimal action. The best leaders access their purpose especially when facing the unknown, drawing on the source of it to energize themselves. Purpose also redefines their relationships to stress, allowing them to thrive where others just survived, and to postpone momentary, fleeting rewards in favor of leaving a sustained, meaningful impact.Accessible, methodical, and eminently practical, Leading from Purpose offers the comprehensive toolbox with which everyone--whether a c-suite executive of behind-the-scenes office worker--can live out their purpose and achieve success on their own terms.If you find yourself in an organization that is struggling to live its purpose, Craig's insights on how to bring your purpose and the organization's purpose into the same room at the same time is game-changing and will redefine your life and career."
9789629967765,"This book is a study of the social and cultural change in Ming China's lower Yangzi delta region from about 1500 to 1644. It takes three social groups�literati, scholar-officials, and merchants�as the framework for discussing the political, socio-economic, and cultural forces that coalesced and reinforced one another to influence and facilitate the region's change. A still wider perspective reveals how the region's political ties with the state and commercial links with external markets impacted the region for better and for worse. The book also discusses the literati's reflection and discourse, which their participation in the change generated, on the issues of morality, money, politics, and disorder. The book evokes the richly textured social and cultural life of Ming China's heartland in an age of commercial and cultural vigor, which then descended into distress and despair. For scholars and for others conversant with Chinese history, and Ming history in particular, the extensive use of literati sources and the references to contemporary scholarship will be of interest."

9789863594444,"從繪畫到拼貼，用多元媒材玩出豐富驚嘆的作品！
每個單元的創意時間(Lab time)，讓讀者輕鬆學著做！

以不同的視角，豐富的插畫，激發創意，人人都可以有精采的作品。用各式各樣的創意練習，豐富自己的繪畫作品。
本書裡，作者以插畫藝術的方向，來分享視覺創作的一些技法。除了繪畫以外，還有更多不同的影像創作技法，來幫助讀者用更多元的方式來創作。

這本書並非著重在繪畫技巧，而是提倡「實驗」的重要性和勇氣，並提供讀者更多的創作方式的選擇。本書在章節一開始會提到關於如何創造出好的圖像，包括主題架構和概念傳達的方向，再來就是探討創作方式和使用媒材，包括有線條繪畫（Drawing）、顏料繪畫（Painting）、簡易版畫製作（Print Making）、創意字體（Creative Typography）、相片結合（Photography）、剪紙與拼貼（Paper Cut） 、插畫立體作品（Illustrative Sculpture）。並在每個章節提供「創意練習實驗」的實際操作方式，讓讀者可以輕鬆跟著做。

此外這本書也和多位插畫藝術家和視覺創作者的合作，在每段章節中，作者都會提出各種創作方式的有效媒材、創作過程、還有藝術家們的一些範例作品，讓讀者能夠在實驗過程中得到更充分的資訊和擴展創作的可能性。

◎如何創造精彩的手繪圖
一張畫的驚艷度，不應該只持續在第一次看見的時候，應該是長久而有層次的。畫的內容也不一定要特別複雜或壯觀才有效果，而是可以慢慢帶領觀眾一步一步發現畫裡的流動，這一切都是需要設計巧思的。

◎筆類繪畫
乾淨俐落的手繪線條有直接、篤定、信心的感覺，也讓圖像人物呈現出俐落大方的觀感。不完美的線條往往更帶有故事性及它的成熟度並且開拓出個人風格，也使圖畫更有真性情的味道。

◎顏料繪畫
進入了顏料繪畫領域，因媒材、畫法、顏色的多種作法而有了不一樣的走向。利用顏料的屬性做實驗也是一種方法，像是多水可暈染、快乾可乾刷、透明或飽和的顏色、渲染或堆疊技巧等等進行變化。

◎簡易版畫製作
麻膠版畫（Linocut）是凸版和雕刻版畫的一種，十九世紀早期很多書本、藏書票等等的圖案設計與印刷就是使用這樣的製作方式，跟刻印章的方式相同。手工雕刻出的圖案在印出後，也能特別顯現出作品手刻的味道和美感。

◎手創字型
創造有趣的字型，可以先從元素開始，而元素的方向可以從主題開始，例如：動物、花、微生物等等的題材，或者以自己想像的形狀為出發點，再隨著字母或部首本身的寫法和方向來衍生出創意的插畫字體。

◎剪紙拼貼
這是個充滿奇幻的創作方式，也是個充滿驚奇的創作過程。用色紙和特殊紙張為資源，有著鮮豔的顏色和個人化的形狀去創作剪紙和拼貼影像，會使插畫更有一致性並且顯現出更多的個人風格。這時剪刀變成了畫筆，用剪紙的方式去創造自我風格的形狀。

Drawing on previously unavailable primary sources, Noriko Kawamura traces Hirohito's actions from the late 1920s to the end of the war, analyzing the role Hirohito played in Japan's expansion. Emperor Hirohito emerges as a conflicted man who struggled throughout the war to deal with the undefined powers bestowed upon him as a monarch, often juggling the contradictory positions and irreconcilable differences advocated by his subordinates. Kawamura shows that he was by no means a pacifist, but neither did he favor the reckless wars advocated by Japan's military leaders."

City of Virtues examines the ways a series of visionaries, drawing on past glories of the city, projected their ideologies onto Nanjing as they constructed buildings, performed rituals, and reworked the literary heritage of the city. More than an urban history of Nanjing from the late 18th century until 1911 ? encompassing the Opium War, the Taiping occupation of the city, the rebuilding of the city by Zeng Guofan, and attempts to establish it as the capital of the Republic of China ? this study shows how utopian visions of the cosmos shaped Nanjing?s path through the turbulent 19th century."

China is less strong economically and more dictatorial politically than the world has wanted to believe. By analysing the leadership of Xi Jinping, the meaning of �socialist market economy�, corruption, the party-state apparatus, the reach of the party, the mechanisms of repression, taxation and public services, and state-society relations, the book broadens the field of China studies, as well as the fields of political economy, comparative politics, development, and welfare state studies."

In Grit, she takes readers into the field to visit cadets struggling through their first days at West Point, teachers working in some of the toughest schools, and young finalists in the National Spelling Bee. She also mines fascinating insights from history and shows what can be gleaned from modern experiments in peak performance. Finally, she shares what she’s learned from interviewing dozens of high achievers—from JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon to New Yorker cartoon editor Bob Mankoff to Seattle Seahawks Coach Pete Carroll. Among Grit’s most valuable insights:  *Why any effort you make ultimately counts twice toward your goal *How grit can be learned, regardless of I.Q. or circumstances *How lifelong interest is triggered *How much of optimal practice is suffering and how much ecstasy *Which is better for your child—a warm embrace or high standards *The magic of the Hard Thing Rule Winningly personal, insightful, and even life-changing, Grit is a book about what goes through your head when you fall down, and how that—not talent or luck—makes all the difference."

9780465049691,"Shortly after arriving in the White House in early 1933, Franklin Roosevelt took the United States off the gold standard. His opponents thought his decision unwise at best, and ruinous at worst. But they could not have been more wrong.With The Money Makers, Eric Rauchway tells the absorbing story of how FDR and his advisors pulled the levers of monetary policy to save the domestic economy and propel the United States to unprecedented prosperity and superpower status. Drawing on the ideas of the brilliant British economist John Maynard Keynes, among others, Roosevelt created the conditions for recovery from the Great Depression, deploying economic policy to fight the biggest threat then facing the nation: deflation.Throughout the 1930s, he also had one eye on the increasingly dire situation in Europe. In order to defeat Hitler, Roosevelt turned again to monetary policy, sending dollars abroad to prop up the faltering economies of Britain and, beginning in 1941, the Soviet Union. FDR's fight against economic depression and his fight against fascism were indistinguishable. As Rauchway writes, ""Roosevelt wanted to ensure more than business recovery; he wanted to restore American economic and moral strength so the US could defend civilization itself."" The economic and military alliance he created proved unbeatable-and also provided the foundation for decades of postwar prosperity. Indeed, Rauchway argues that Roosevelt's greatest legacy was his monetary policy. Even today, the ""Roosevelt dollar"" remains both the symbol and the catalyst of America's vast economic power.The Money Makers restores the Roosevelt dollar to its central place in our understanding of FDR, the New Deal, and the economic history of twentieth-century America. We forget this history at our own peril. In revealing the roots of our postwar prosperity, Rauchway shows how we can recapture the abundance of that period in our own."

0095115186923,"Our re-release of the 1992 recording of Tippett’s A Child of Our Time is Disc of the Month in this new wave of additions to Chandos’ ongoing Hickox Legacy series.Recreating in contemporary terms a traditional form in Western music, one that goes back to the Lutheran Passions of J.S. Bach and the great Old and New Testament oratories of Handel, and drawing on the familiar musico-dramatic conventions of the genre – recitative, aria, ensemble, chorus, chorale, and the continuous presence of the orchestra – Tippett both re-affirms and transforms the genre. The most striking and brilliant transformation is the composer’s choice of the Negro Spiritual in place of the congregational hymn.This oratorio, composed between 1939 and 1941 and premiered in 1944, was born out of a very personal sense of human deprivation and hardship; during the hard times in England in the thirties Tippett had shared his choral craft with community workers, and during the war he inspired unemployed professional musicians and amateurs as a choral and orchestral conductor at Morley College."

7318599920931,"An earlier recording of orchestral works by Sebastian Fagerlund was described in BBC Music Magazine as displaying 'boundless technical resource at the service of a considerable imagination'. These qualities, and his receptivity towards different musical traditions Fagerlund shares with Pekka Kuusisto, to whom the violin concerto Darkness in Light is dedicated. The title of the work is a subtle reference to a quote from author Haruki Murakami's novella Firefly: 'Death is not the opposite of life, but a part of it'. The disc closes with the orchestral work Ignite, composed for and performed here by the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, under its chief conductor Hannu Lintu."

9780804792066,"The Taiping Rebellion was one of the costliest civil wars in human history. Many millions of people lost their lives. Yet while the Rebellion has been intensely studied by scholars in China and elsewhere, we still know little of how individuals coped with these cataclysmic events.Drawing upon a rich array of primary sources, What Remains  explores the issues that preoccupied Chinese and Western survivors. Individuals, families, and communities grappled with fundamental questions of loyalty and loss as they struggled to rebuild shattered cities, bury the dead, and make sense of the horrors that they had witnessed.Driven by compelling accounts of raw emotion and deep injury, What Remains opens a window to a world described by survivors themselves. This book transforms our understanding of China's 19th century and recontextualizes suffering and loss in China during the 20th century.By calling attention to the human costs of China's Taiping War, What Remains offers new perspectives on issues of abiding interest to historians of 19th and 20th century China: the effects of lingering dynastic decline, the effects of violence on local communities, the emergence of elite activism, and the changing relationship between state and society."

To find a modern way of using the expressive instruments of the 18th century, he had to go back to the drawing board, with his Europa Galante orchestra, founded in 1989.In 1991, this dazzling interpretation by Europa Galante, the ensemble’s first recording, brought instant recognition, propelling the ‘Red Priest’ into the modern world. Fabio Biondi’s ensemble – featuring harpsichordist Rinaldo Alessandrini, another pioneer of the baroque renaissance with his own Concerto Italiano – gives the impression of overflowing off the concert stage.

In its early decades it was a centre of colonial life in Hong Kong. More recently, it has opened itself widely to other communities in Hong Kong, becoming a truly international church with services held in several languages. Drawing on extensive archives, and written in a lively style, this first comprehensive history of St John’s traces the cathedral’s roles as a colonial parish church and as a bishop’s seat for a diocese that once covered the whole of China and beyond. It also discusses St John’s significance as a cente of worship for a modern cosmopolitan community.Imperial to International is the first volume in the new series Sheng Kung Hui: Historical Studies of Anglican Christianity in China, co-published by the Hong Kong University Press and the Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui."
9789888139002,"On 20 December 1999 the city of Macau became a Special Administrative Region of China after nearly 450 years of Portuguese administration. Drawing extensively on Portuguese and other sources, and on interviews with key participants, this book examines the strategies and policies adopted by the Portuguese government during the negotiations. The study sets these events in the larger context of Portugal’s retreat from empire, the British experience with Hong Kong, and changing social and political conditions within Macau. A weak player on the international stage, Portugal was still able to obtain concessions during the negotiations, notably in the timing of the retrocession and continuing Portuguese nationality arrangements for some Macau citizens. Yet the tendency of Portuguese leaders to use the Macau question as a tool in their domestic political agendas hampered their ability to develop an effective strategy and left China with the freedom to control the process of negotiation.The first sustained analysis of the Macau negotiations from the Portuguese perspective, this book will be of interest to historians, diplomats, and students of international relations."

Until the founding of Hong Kong and the opening of other ports in the 1840s, it was also the main gateway to China for independent British merchants and their only place of permanent residence. Drawing extensively on Portuguese as well as British sources, The British Presence in Macau traces Anglo-Portuguese relations in South China from the first arrival of English trading ships in the 1630s to the establishment of factories at Canton, the beginnings of the opium trade, and the Macartney Embassy of 1793. The British and Portuguese�longstanding allies in the West�pursued more complex relations in the East, as trading interests clashed under a Chinese imperial system and as the British increasingly asserted their power as �a community in search of a colony�."

Charismatic behaviors can be learned and perfected by anyone.Drawing on techniques she originally developed for Harvard and MIT, Cabane breaks charisma down into its components.

Islam in Hong Kong explores the lives of Muslims as ethnic and religious minorities in this unique post-colonial Chinese city. Drawing on interviews with Muslims of different origins, O'Connor builds a detailed picture of daily life through topical chapters on language, space, religious education, daily prayers, maintaining a halal diet in a Chinese environment, racism, and other subjects. Although the picture that emerges is complex and ambiguous, one striking conclusion is that Muslims in Hong Kong generally find acceptance as a community and do not consider themselves to be victimised because of their religion. "
0652637321814,"Released on July 24th, 2012, Shrines is the debut album by Purity Ring, a Halifax/Montreal-based duo comprised of Corin Roddick and Megan James.Purity Ring make lullabies for the club, drawing equally from airy 90s R&B, lush dream pop, and the powerful, bone-rattling immediacy of modern hip hop. Megan’s remarkable voice is at once ecstatic and ethereal, soaring joyfully through Corin’s carefully chopped beats, trembling synths, and skewed vocal samples.Despite the band’s young age (Corin is 21, Megan 24) and short gestation (they formed in late 2010), Purity Ring have delivered one of 2012's most assured – and anticipated – debuts with Shrines. Indeed, Shrines feels like anything but a first record - its vocal hooks are inescapable, its lush production futuristic and sophisticated but also as pristine as anything on pop radio. The record's eleven tracks trace a unique aesthetic universe that is carefully crafted and fully realized - deftly walking the lines between trap-rap exhilaration and otherworldly rapture, pleasure-center pop and diaristic emotion, childlike dread and total self-possession. Purity Ring's is a universe that invites exploration and demands revisiting."
0028947639770,"Strangely beautiful album from Heinz Holliger, with the Swiss composer drawing inspiration from very Swiss sources. The centrepiece of this recording is the vocal cycle “Puneigä” which sets the poetry of Anna Maria Bacher, who writes in an idiom threatened by extinction: the Walser-German language of Pumattertisch, native to the Pomater valley. “Holliger regards a word, like a breath or a heartbeat, as a physical impulse” (Michael Kunkel, in the liner notes). Soprano Sylvia Hopper sings, amid transient sounds intoned by flute, horn, cello and viola. Mrs Bacher also recites her verse in a sequence of unaccompanied readings. “Induuchlen” itself is comprised of four songs with words by Albert Streich, for countertenor and natural horn, and the album is bookended by two pieces set up to challenge the resourcefulness of ensemble players and soloists - “Toronto Excercises” and “Ma’mounia” - with Holliger in conductor’s role. The recording is issued simultaneously with Holliger’s Bach album “Ich hatte viel Bekümmernis”.

0028947644996,"Estonian ensemble Vox Clamantis brings together singers and instrumentalists who share an interest in Gregorian chant as the basis of all European art music. Their interpretation of medieval music is never purely ‘historical’: while always remaining true to the spirit of this repertoire, the approach to the work and the selection of pieces is contemporary. On the present disc, drawing upon the rich tradition in music history on the theme of „Filia Sion“, Vox Clamantis presents medieval music from Gregorian chant to works by Perotinus, Hildegard von Bingen and Petrus Wilhelmi de Grudencz. In the Old Testament, ""Filia Sion"" – the Daughter of Zion – refers to both the holy city of Jerusalem and the Jewish people who built the Temple on Mount Zion. In medieval Christian tradition, Holy Mary became the incarnation of the Daughter of Zion as the personification of the church."

9780307951793,"By understanding how and when common sense fails, we can improve our understanding of the present and better plan for the future. Drawing on the latest scientific research, along with a wealth of historical and contemporary examples, Watts shows how common sense reasoning and history conspire to mislead us into believing that we understand more about the world of human behavior than we do; and in turn, why attempts to predict, manage, or manipulate social and economic systems so often go awry.It seems obvious, for example, that people respond to incentives; yet policy makers and managers alike frequently fail to anticipate how people will respond to the incentives they create. Social trends often seem to be driven by certain influential people; yet marketers have been unable to identify these “influencers” in advance. And although successful products or companies always seem in retrospect to have succeeded because of their unique qualities, predicting the qualities of the next hit product or hot company is notoriously difficult even for experienced professionals.Watts' argument has important implications in politics, business, and marketing, as well as in science and everyday life."
9789888139118,"In this classic study (1977), James Hayes examines local leadership in six villages and townships in Hong Kong�s rural New Territories during the late Qing. Drawing on a wealth of documentary sources and on fieldwork carried out while serving as a district officer, Hayes makes a powerful argument for the part played by ordinary men � peasants and shopkeepers � in running their own communities almost without interference from either the gentry or state officials. This new edition has a substantial new introduction by the author which reviews the research in the light of later scholarly studies First published in 1977, The Hong Kong Region is a historical reconstruction of village and township society in Hong Kong�s New Territories between 1850 and 1911. In a detailed study drawing on documentary sources and intensive fieldwork, James Hayes argues for the part taken by ordinary peasants and shopkeepers in running their own communities. It was they who dealt virtually unaided with routine administration of local affairs and with every form of disaster, natural or man-made, that visited their communities. The gentry and imperial bureaucracy, in contrast, played almost no role. In a substantial new introduction written for this Echoes reprint, James Hayes reviews the research behind The Hong Kong Region and assesses its wider implications for our understanding of traditional Chinese society in the light of later scholarly studies. "

9789888083114,"American women have lived in Hong Kong, and in neighboring Macao, for nearly two centuries. Many were changed by their encounter with Chinese life and British colonialism. Their openness to new experiences set them apart both individually and as a group. Equally, a certain ""pedagogical impulse"" gave them a reputation for outspokenness that sometimes troubled those around them. Drawing on memoirs, diaries, newspapers, film, and other texts, Stacilee Ford tells the stories of several American women and explores how, through dramatically changing times, they communicated their notions of national identity and gender. Troubling American Women is a lively and provocative study of cross-cultural encounters, shedding light on the connections between the histories of Hong Kong and the US, on the impact of Americanization in Hong Kong, and on the ways in which Hong Kong people used stereotypes of American womanhood in popular culture. Troubling American Women will appeal to students and scholars in history, gender and cultural studies and to all readers with an interest in the encounter between China and the West."

Package includes a bonus CD-ROM which contains custom-created movies employing Lindgren's Sonic Visualization treatment to four of these works.Erik Lindgren Scores! acknowledges the artist's deep-rooted sensitivity and allegiance to the Classical tradition and is a logical extension of his twenty-year tenure with the breakthrough modern music ensemble Birdsongs of the Mesozoic.

 is the story of Milly Theale, a naïve, doomed American heiress, and a 
pair of lovers, Kate Croy and Merton Densher, who conspire to obtain her
 fortune. In this witty tragedy of treachery, self-deception, and

9780141439723,"Charles Dickens's masterful assault on the injustices of the British legal systemAs the interminable case of 'Jarndyce and Jarndyce' grinds its way through the Court of Chancery, it draws together a disparate group of people: Ada and Richard Clare, whose inheritance is gradually being devoured by legal costs; Esther Summerson, a ward of court, whose parentage is a source of deepening mystery; the menacing lawyer Tulkinghorn; the determined sleuth Inspector Bucket; and even Jo, the destitute little crossing-sweeper. A savage, but often comic, indictment of a society that is rotten to the core, Bleak House is one of Dickens's most ambitious novels, with a range that extends from the drawing rooms of the aristocracy to the poorest of London slums. This edition follows the first book edition of 1853, and includes all the original illustrations by 'Phiz', as well as appendices on the Chancery and spontaneous combustion. In his preface, Terry Eagleton examines characterisation and considers Bleak House as an early work of detective fiction. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

The theme of the poet as troubadour runs throughout the bookthere is a wry humor in Soto's description of the drunken narrator of ""The Mariachi Suit,"" who, with ""spurs jangling music"" and a ""guitar like a small coffin in my arms,"" serenades an audience of cats, ""Who yawn, lick the clover pads/Of their salty paws, and prance away."" A delightful poem to Soto's wife of 23 years (""Meat and Potatoes"") playfully contrasts a miserable bachelor meal with the exotic cooking of the woman next door: ""Love was at her table,/A fork going to her mouth and the noodles,/How delicious, easy to swallow.""

,"英國查爾斯王子擁有另一個身分：水彩畫家。他將帶我們穿越時空，呈現維多利亞女王等皇室成員的藝術天份，瞭解他們對藝術的喜好與傳承。這部寓教於樂且發人省思的影片深具歷史價值，更讓我們一窺皇室畫廊的美好藝術。

英國皇室從古至今的藝術家多不勝數，有的將藝術當成嗜好，有的做為職業。影片將難得呈現早期皇室成員的藝術之作。由查爾斯王子親自導覽，一一介紹祖先在溫莎城堡所留下的作品，看見維多利亞女王及她九個孩子的素描本。維多利亞女王筆下的風景畫、對孩子的描繪、海外風情紀錄令人驚艷，連她使用過的畫盒和她的日記摘錄片段，也將毫無保留地展露我們眼前。透過皇家畫廊，我們也彷如親炙巴爾摩洛城堡、溫莎城堡、海格洛夫莊園、浮若閣摩爾宮及奧斯本宮，看見不同季節中壯闊的美景。王室的美術教師包括根茲波洛、李爾、蘭德斯爾、卡森，據說大藝術收藏家查理一世國王還曾拜魯本斯為師。某些皇室畫廊的作品，影響所及，甚至為吉爾丁、桑德比和泰納等知名畫家帶來啟發。"
0028948104260,"睿智成熟的美麗身影，本作《鐘聲谷》(La vallée des cloches)是現居於巴黎的日本女性鋼琴演奏家兒玉桃(Momo Kodama)交出的第一張ECM成績單。從演繹拉威爾的《鏡之組曲》(Miroirs)、到武滿徹的《雨樹素描》(Rain Tree Sketch)、以及奧立佛．梅湘的《園中之鶯》(La fauvette des jardins)，橫跨百年的現代音樂史，東西方的摸索和探究，琴法嫻熟，兒玉桃的演奏充滿了無比的自信風采。

原為為了革新古典音樂並打破舊有巢臼、創作於1905年的《鏡之組曲》，拉威爾反叛的性格透露出他渴望自由的夢想，他以描繪天地美景的敘事方式作曲，全曲共計五個篇章－「夜蛾」、「悲傷之鳥」、「海上孤舟」、「小丑的晨歌」、「鐘聲谷」，兒玉桃投以感情入樂，呈現出美妙夢幻的意境，令人難以忘懷。

向著名作家大江建三郎的小說致敬，日本現代作曲家武滿徹譜於1984年的《雨樹素描》，以東方哲思引入、輔以西方的實驗科學作曲，兒玉桃的演奏則是充滿了禪學的想像，引人入勝。

鋼琴琴音與大自然結合的完美極致，臨摹五彩繽紛的鳥兒啼鳴，《園中之鶯》無疑是法國作曲家/鳥類學家奧立佛．梅湘的巔峰之作，其中十八種鳥鳴歌唱的寫照，兒玉桃用生動靈巧的揣摩，「唱」出亮眼的獨特聲響。"

9789865959401,【內容簡介】走到哪裡畫到哪裡野村老師教你邊玩邊畫！  戶外寫生的概念興起於19世紀的法國，管狀顏料與火車的發明，讓畫家們可以攜帶著簡便的材料當天來回於郊區進行創作，於是悠然的天地風景躍升為畫布的主題，時時刻刻變化的光影成了畫家們探索的目標。不同於照片拍攝只要手指一按，寫生是經過仔細觀察當天氣候、光線狀況，以及光影在物體上形成的狀態，再將自己的體驗轉換到紙張上面。因此寫生作品固然不如照片精準，但更能令人聯想起旅行的點點滴滴。  或許你會覺得，自己連室內長時間的素描都畫不好了，更何況是跟時間賽跑的戶外寫生。其實寫生相當簡單，只要準備素描本、筆，簡便的水彩顏料，花個20分鐘，概略掌握物體形態與光影變化，就是一幅充滿氣氛的作品。  本書由日本NHK文化講座的人氣講師 ─ 野村重存，帶領你我走遍日本各大風景名勝。一邊欣賞自然美景，一邊講解水彩寫生的技巧。先以手指作框找出想畫的風景，接著以素描打底稿，加上淡彩，利用色彩深淺做出正確的明暗變化……慢慢的，眼前的風景，就這麼栩栩如生的呈現在畫紙上。在室內教室練習久了，這次來堂戶外體驗課吧！  【本書特色】基本技巧一本通從挑選畫紙畫筆的方法，到掌握遠近法的方式，以及基礎的混色概念……各種繪畫基礎知識都有詳細說明。充分掌握本書內容，即使是第一次畫水彩也可以上手。全方位收錄各種美麗風景。 不論是寧靜的山川或壯麗的海景，還是由木造建築構成的古剎寺廟……，各種別具特色的風景，均實際進行探訪描繪。搭配實際描繪步驟圖 從取景的方法，到打稿與上色，每款範例均附有詳細的步驟分解圖，讀者只要跟著書中指示，Step by Step，相信一定可以完成屬於自己的作品。實用小撇步讓寫生更輕鬆想描畫的細節太多但時間太趕怎麼辦，風景太遼闊要如何取景、讓水彩紙不起皺的水裱方式……在做畫時可能會遇到的疑難雜症，本書都有解決方法！

9781616890582,"Now in Paperback! What does history look like? How do you draw time? Cartographies of Time is the first history of the timeline, written engagingly and with incredible visuals. The authors, both accomplished writers and historians, sketch the shifting field of graphic representations of history from the beginning of the print age through the present. They shed light on western views of history and on the complex relationship between general ideas about the course of events and the technical efforts to record and connect dates and names in the past. In addition to telling a rich, forgotten story, this book serves as a kind of grammar of historical representation, uncovering the ways in which time has been structured in thought and in images, in the Western tradition. Written for both the academically curious and the general reader, Cartographies of Time provides a set of tools for understanding the evolution and the significance of graphic representations of time both in history and in contemporary culture."

「巨匠神工」這套書為作者二十年來中國古建築之考察心得總結，《神靈的殿堂》所收錄者，皆屬宗教性建築，表現出人對超自然的敬畏，包括佛寺、佛塔、石窟、喇嘛寺、道觀與伊斯蘭清真寺等；共6大類27座經典個案。每一經典個案作者皆以最能彰顯各個古建築特色的透視彩圖，加上實景攝影圖像與特色導覽，引領讀者進入時光隧道，甚至「穿牆破壁」，領略古代匠師高超的工藝技術，體驗每一座古建築令人驚豔的空間美感。 

在經典個案之後，另有同類型其他實例的介紹與比較；而「延伸議題」則以簡練的文字、精細的手繪線圖與大量的攝影圖片，歸納整理中國古建築之基本欣賞知識。最後並附中國古建築常見之術語詞解。

李乾朗精通中國傳統建築的構造技法與裝飾加工，以充滿感情的目光，讓豐富的細節在現代甦活……。這是一部古建築巡禮不可欠缺、重要而珍貴的著作。
──杉浦康平

《巨匠神工》是一本中國古建築解密入手之好書。
──李祖原

乾朗每調查一處古建築時都是用全身心去體察的，書中的數十幅圖畫即是作者的心血之作！
──林洙

乾朗兄一定是那千年木作老匠師，幾番幻化轉世、穿越千年時空復返而來，目的是為了掃描他那累生累世所建造的，且尚還留在人世間的老建築……        
──登琨艷 

他好像有透視眼，能看穿房子，理出結構。好幾百幅黑線圖稿就是這樣出來的，張張都是古建築的寶貝。        
──黃永松

他的雙手一如傳統建築師……以致能深入淺出地帶領著神往者撥開迷霧，進而觸及中國建築的精髓。 
──黃永洪

這可能是中國古建築著作中，表達最清楚，內容最精準，圖面最悅目的一部書。

9784902943061,"本書是紐約近代美術館（MOMA）收藏的奈良美智作品「沒有人知道的素描本」，收集奈良美智私底下的塗鴉、創作概念的發想。想要一窺藝術家的隨筆、靈感，沈浸在奈良美智的秘密世界嗎？本書值得您收藏！

曾被東京武藏野美術大學退學、後畢業於愛知縣立藝術大學並留學德國的奈良美智，筆下的招牌便是頭大大的小孩、潔白馴良的狗、以及身著綿羊裝的兒童，非常可愛；創作素材有大幅的壓克力畫作也有立體的多媒材或陶瓷雕塑作品。但若只是如此則跟一般的日本商業流行圖像無異。奈良筆下的人物，其臉上那對眼尾上吊、不懷好意的雙眼其實才是他作品的正字招牌。那種眼中露出一付「看什麼看？你管我！」的不友善神情，但同時卻又身處在寂寥、淡漠背景中的畫作主角們，讓人一看到就捨不得把眼睛轉開。有的時候畫中小孩的手裡還會拿著小刀，有時則是頭上綁著繃帶或插了根冒著血的釘子，或是那些閉著眼不斷流淚的狗，這種欲言又止的受傷動物神情似乎牽動了心裡的什麼，跟純粹的可愛是很不一樣的。他的作品深受大眾喜愛，也在國際間獲得注目，許多作品已被美術館購入成為日本近代美術的典藏品。"

9789867809285,"本書主要的內容是要解說產品設計師的速寫圖，採用鉛筆為主要的繪圖工具。以作者前數年的速寫圖作品為實例，嘗試將設計師經常使用的溝通技法-速寫圖(sketch)的用途目標、內容元素、表達方法、以及強化繪圖效果的方法，區分章節並且用圖文搭配的方式呈現給讀者，希望透過這樣的實例介紹方式，可以讓初學者或者有興趣於設計速寫圖的同好讀者，能夠更了解速寫圖在設計實務上的做法。■作者簡介涂永祥現任教大同大學工業設計系"
,"◎本CD包裝採用類似黑膠套的設計，質感超優相較於備受好評的首張專輯《Yupi》，日本多媒體藝術家Kazumasa Hashimoto這次捨棄長篇迂迴的景觀氣氛營造，而選用小品格式抒發較明亮討喜的情緒；不變的是他以鋼琴為核心加上靈巧的嗶叭噪音所刻畫出的蔥鬱聲音世界，其豐富多變的意象依然引人入勝。隨著他參與坂本龍一主導的「CODE」、有機會與細野晴臣和高橋幸宏的Sketch Show同台演出，並為德國廠牌Morr Music的日本巡迴暖場，更多人開始意識到Hashimoto的音樂才華。"
