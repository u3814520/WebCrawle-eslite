9780198860792,"This is the first textbook which presents the theory of pure discrete communication systems and its relation to the existing theory of digital and analog communications at a graduate level. Based on the orthogonality principles and theory of discrete time stochastic processes, a generic structure of communication systems, based on correlation demodulation and optimum detection, is developed and presented in the form of mathematical operators with precisely defined inputs and outputsand related functions. Based on this generic structure, the traditionally defined phase shift keying (PSK), frequency shift keying (FSK), quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and code division multiple access (CDMA) systems are deduced as itsspecial cases. The main chapters, presenting the theory of communications, are supported by a set of supplementary chapters containing the theory of deterministic and stochastic signal processing, which makes the book a self-contained presentation of the subject. The book uses unified notation and unified terminology, which allows a clear distinction between deterministic and stochastic signals, power signals and energy signals, discrete time signals and processes and continuous time signals and processes, and an easy way of understanding the differences indefining the correlation functions, power and energy spectral densities, and amplitudes and power spectra of the mentioned signals and processes. In addition to solved examples in the text, about 300 solved problems are available to readers in the supplementary material that aim to enhance the understanding of the theory in the text. In addition, five research Projects are added to be used by lecturers or instructors that aim to enhance theunderstanding of theory and to establish its relation to the practice."

This second edition continues to offer a systematic, clear, and intuitive introduction to multirate signal processing for working engineers and system designers. Significant new material and fresh concepts, including Green Signal Processing techniques have been introduced. The author uses extensive examples and figures to illustrate a wide range of multirate techniques, from basic resampling to leading-edge cascade and multi-stage filter structures. Along the way he draws on extensive research and consulting experience to introduce processing ""tricks"" shown to maximize performance and efficiency. Coverage includes: Effect of sampling and resampling in time and frequency domainsRelationships between FIR filter specifications and filter length (# of taps)Window design and equal-ripple (Remez) design techniquesSquare-Root Nyquist and Half-band Filters including new enhancementsPolyphase FIR filters: up-sampling, down-samplingPolyphase M-path analysis and synthesis channelizers and cascade pairsPolyphase interpolators for arbitrary sample rate changesDyadic half-band filters, quadrature mirror filtersChannel banks for multiple arbitrary bandwidths and center frequenciesComprehensive coverage of recursive all-pass filters and channelizers, non-uniform and uniform phase, mixed recursive and non-recursiveComparisons with traditional DSP designsExtensive applications coverage throughout"
9783030577056,"This book serves as an easily accessible reference for wireless digital communication systems. Topics are presented with simple but non-trivial examples and then elaborated with their variations and sophistications. The book includes numerous examples and exercises to illustrate key points. For this new edition, a set of problems at the end of each chapter is added, for a total of 298 problems. The book emphasizes both practical problem solving and a thorough understanding of fundamentals, aiming to realize the complementary relationship between practice and theory. Though the author emphasizes wireless radio channels, the fundamentals that are covered here are useful to different channels - digital subscriber line, coax, power lines, optical fibers, and even Gigabit serial connections. The material in chapters 5 (OFDM), 6 (Channel coding), 7 (Synchronization), and 8 (Transceivers) contains new and updated information, not explicitly available in typical textbooks, and useful in practice. For example, in chapter 5, all known orthogonal frequency division multiplex signals are derived from its digitized analog FDM counterparts. Thus, it is flexible to have different pulse shape for subcarriers, and it can be serial transmission as well as block transmission. Currently predominant cyclic prefix based OFDM is a block transmission using rectangular pulse in time domain. This flexibility may be useful in certain applications.

9780995022409,"This book provides an insight into techniques that are commonly used in the design of modern RF communications equipment. Although the emphasis is on equipment or circuits that are part of communication systems, information is provided on a variety of general electronic design topics. It is assumed that the reader has a general understanding of basic electronic concepts, such as that required to pass the U.S. General or the Canadian Advanced Amateur exam. No special mathematical skills should be necessary to make use of the material that is presented - basic Grade 10 algebra will be sufficient. No calculus will be used at any time. Some basic trigonometry is required in a few places, but a simple tutorial on the necessary concepts is provided in one of the Appendices.This is not intended to be a formal text book with rigorous explanations, derivations, and difficult mathematics. It is assumed that the reader would prefer to get a good understanding of how circuits work, with just enough detail so that designs can be analyzed in a basic manner. Where appropriate, approximations and ""rules of thumb"" will be disclosed that can often simplify the design process. The book includes several design examples."

9780988873506,"Digital Signal Processing in Modern Communication Systems takes you on a journey that starts with basic DSP principles and ends with a treatment of modern wireless modems like OFDM and single-tone transceivers. Throughout this journey, we will cover signal processing topics that are applicable not just to the field of communications but to many engineering disciplines. This text steps outside the often dry mathematical presentation of more traditional DSP books and provides a more intuitive approach to this fascinating topic. Some of this book's uniqueness can be summarized as follows: - An intuitive approach to the topic of digital signal processing. - Working in-book MatLab examples supporting all important concepts. - A large scope covering basic concepts (correlation, convolution, DFT, FIR filters ...) as well as advanced topics (optimization, adaptive signal processing, equalization, OFDM, MIMO ... ). - MatLab modeling of analog/RF effects (multipath channel, thermal noise, phase noise, IQ imbalances, DC and frequency offsets) that must be addressed and solved in modern modem design. - Real world topics that go beyond the ordinary communication textbooks such as signal synchronization, modem rate management, and fixed-point effects. All in all, this book is a must-have for students and practicing engineers who want to build upon the principles of Digital Signal Processing, enrich their understanding with advanced topics, and then apply that knowledge to the design of modern wireless modems."

9783037682395,"The purpose and primary function of wayfinding and signage design is to provide spatial orientation as quickly and clearly as possible. Respective concepts and systems can be designed for individual buildings, for example corporate headquarters, museums or hospitals, for areas such as a university campus or distinct municipal district, or for entire systems like a city’s public transport. In addition to communicating direction, the interplay of typography, pictograms, materials, colors and shapes in these systems also delineates a particular identity of the location. On the basis of international realizations this title shows the range of different approaches and implementation possibilities of environmental graphics. No matter what kind of spatial context, the focus is always on visual communication that is understandable for every user. This volume is an indispensable reference work for anyone involved in communications, as well as for architects, interior designers, graphic designers, and indeed creative minds of any sectors."
