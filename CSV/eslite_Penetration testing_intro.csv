The more connected we are, the more information is held about everything. Yummy, juicy information for both a penetration tester or a malicious actor. Learning what sources of are available to start your search is an important first step in learning about reconnaissance and how the information could be utilized or resold. Both issues you or your client need to know. All of the tools and techniques in this book can be ninjafied with Python, Ruby or PowerShell. Initially, this book began as a presentation at the Cyber Senate Industrial Control Cybersecurity Nuclear Summit in Warrington, UK 2016. Originally, I intended to use some of the same techniques to target a nuclear power plant or someone in a nuclear regulatory capacity. After submitting my original talk idea. Daesh, otherwise known as ISIS, began publicly threatening the European nuclear industry. Due to the threats, we decided it wasn't in anyone's best interest to give a how to target nuclear installations and changed the target instead to the law firm behind the Panama Papers fiasco. The project expanded to include additional targets with mostly a political slant. 2016 was a very tumultuous year in politics. Brexit, Trump, and the rise of the interesting politics and coups in Turkey, Netherlands, Germany, Russia, Bulgaria and the Philippines. It's a lot more fun to learn about a topic in an empowering way. Also, only politicians like politicians. They make a fun target. Learning a new technique is easier when it's fun. I chose targets and case studies which gave me a happy hacker smile."

They provided a secure and reliable foundation, allowing us to concentrate on securing our digital world.An amazing community has built up around Kali Linux. Every month, more than 300,000 of us download a version of Kali. We come together in online and real-world training rooms and grind through the sprawling Offensive Security Penetration Testing Labs, pursuing the near-legendary Offensive Security certifications. We come together on the Kali forums, some 40,000 strong, and hundreds of us at a time can be found on the Kali IRC channel. We gather at conferences and attend Kali Dojos to learn from the developers themselves how to best leverage Kali.However, the Kali team has never released an official Kali Linux manual, until now.In this book, we'll focus on the Kali Linux platform itself, and help you understand and maximize Kali from the ground up. The developers will walk you through Kali Linux features and fundamentals, provide a crash course in basic Linux commands and concepts, and then walk you through the most common Kali Linux installation scenarios. You'll learn how to configure, troubleshoot and secure Kali Linux and then dive into the powerful Debian package manager. Throughout this expansive section, you'll learn how to install and configure packages, how to update and upgrade your Kali installation, and how to create your own custom packages. Then you'll learn how to deploy your custom installation across massive enterprise networks. Finally, you'll be guided through advanced topics such as kernel compilation, custom ISO creation, industrial-strength encryption, and even how to install crypto kill switches to safeguard your sensitive information.Whether you're a veteran or an absolute n00b, this is the best place to start with Kali Linux, the security professional's platform of choice."
9781546492993,"This book is a guide on how to use Kali Linux for penetration testing. It begins by guiding you on how to use the ""Sqlmap"" tool to perform an SQL injection. This will help you seal any loopholes in your databases. The book then guides you on how to use a tool named ""Fluxion"" so as to hack networks which are protected by WPA/WPA2. Brute forcing has been used for carrying out this kind of attack. You will also learn how to check or know the location for a particular IP address in the world. You will learn how to get details about this location in terms of longitude, country, and other parameters. The process of hiding or spoofing MAC addresses for your devices is very important for penetration testing. This book guides you on how to spoof the MAC address of your devices. After developing a website or before you can hack a website, it is good for you to scan it and identify any loopholes or vulnerabilities within it. You can then go ahead and exploit these vulnerabilities, or seal them to prevent a disaster. This book guides you on how to scan a website and identify any vulnerability within it. You are guided on how to hack Android phones by the use of Kali Linux. HTP servers usually have an open FTP port. This book guides you on how to use this port and gain access to the server. You will also know how to carry out a mass mailer attack, as well as password cracking in Kali Linux. The following topics are discussed in this book: - Sqlmap for Website Hacking - How to Hack WPA/WPA2 without Brute Force - Checking for IP Address Location - MAC Address Spoofing - Scanning a Website for Vulnerability - Hacking Android Phones with Kali Linux -Hacking FTP Server in Kali Linux - Creating a Persistent Backdoor in Android - Mass Mailer Attack - Password Cracking"

Kali Linux is the premier platform for testing and maintaining Windows security. Kali is built on the Debian distribution of Linux and shares the legendary stability of that OS. This lets you focus on using the network penetration, password cracking, forensics tools and not the OS. This book has the most advanced tools and techniques to reproduce the methods used by sophisticated hackers to make you an expert in Kali Linux penetration testing. First, you are introduced to Kali's top ten tools and other useful reporting tools. Then, you will find your way around your target network and determine known vulnerabilities to be able to exploit a system remotely. Next, you will prove that the vulnerabilities you have found are real and exploitable. You will learn to use tools in seven categories of exploitation tools. Further, you perform web access exploits using tools like websploit and more. Security is only as strong as the weakest link in the chain. Passwords are often that weak link. Thus, you learn about password attacks that can be used in concert with other approaches to break into and own a network. Moreover, you come to terms with network sniffing, which helps you understand which users are using services you can exploit, and IP spoofing, which can be used to poison a system's DNS cache. Once you gain access to a machine or network, maintaining access is important. Thus, you not only learn penetrating in the machine you also learn Windows privilege's escalations. With easy to follow step-by-step instructions and support images, you will be able to quickly pen test your system and network. What you will learn  Set up Kali Linux for pen testing Map and enumerate your Windows network Exploit several common Windows network vulnerabilities Attack and defeat password schemes on Windows Debug and reverse-engineer Windows programs Recover lost files, investigate successful hacks and discover hidden data in innocent-looking files Catch and hold admin rights on the network, and maintain backdoors on the network after your initial testing is done "
