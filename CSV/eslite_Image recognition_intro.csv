9781484241486,"Gain insights into image-processing methodologies and algorithms, using machine learning and neural networks in Python. This book begins with the environment setup, understanding basic image-processing terminology, and exploring Python concepts that will be useful for implementing the algorithms discussed in the book. You will then cover all the core image processing algorithms in detail before moving onto the biggest computer vision library: OpenCV. You'll see the OpenCV algorithms and how to use them for image processing. The next section looks at advanced machine learning and deep learning methods for image processing and classification. You'll work with concepts such as pulse coupled neural networks, AdaBoost, XG boost, and convolutional neural networks for image-specific applications. Later you'll explore how models are made in real time and then deployed using various DevOps tools. All the concepts in Practical Machine Learning and Image Processing are explained using real-life scenarios. After reading this book you will be able to apply image processing techniques and make machine learning models for customized application.What You Will LearnDiscover image-processing algorithms and their applications using PythonExplore image processing using the OpenCV libraryUse TensorFlow, scikit-learn, NumPy, and other librariesWork with machine learning and deep learning algorithms for image processingApply image-processing techniques to five real-time projectsWho This Book Is ForData scientists and software developers interested in image processing and computer vision."

9781484261675,"Dive into and apply practical machine learning and dataset categorization techniques while learning Tensorflow and deep learning. This book uses convolutional neural networks to do image recognition all in the familiar and easy to work with Swift language. It begins with a basic machine learning overview and then ramps up to neural networks and convolutions and how they work. Using Swift and Tensorflow, you'll perform data augmentation, build and train large networks, and build networks for mobile devices. You'll also cover cloud training and the network you build can categorize greyscale data, such as mnist, to large scale modern approaches that can categorize large datasets, such as imagenet.  Convolutional Neural Networks with Swift for Tensorflow uses a simple approach that adds progressive layers of complexity until you have arrived at the current state of the art for this field. What You'll LearnCategorize and augment datasetsBuild and train large networks, including via cloud solutionsDeploy complex systems to mobile devicesWho This Book Is ForDevelopers with Swift programming experience who would like to learn convolutional neural networks by example using Swift for Tensorflow as a starting point."
