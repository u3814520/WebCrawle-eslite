9781680506969,"Whether you want to automate tasks, analyze data, parse logs, talk to network services, or address other systems requirements, writing your own command-line tool may be the fastest - and perhaps the most fun - way to do it. The Go programming language is a great choice for developing tools that are fast, reliable, and cross-platform. Create command-line tools that work with files, connect to services, and even manage external processes, all while using tests and benchmarks to ensure your programs are fast and correct. When you want to develop cross platform command-line tools that are fast and reliable, use Go, a modern programming language that combines the reliability of compiled languages with the ease of use and flexibility of dynamic typed languages. Work through practical examples to develop elegant and efficient tools by applying Go's rich standard library, its built in support for concurrency, and its expressive syntax. Use Go's integrated testing capabilities to automatically test your tools, ensuring they work reliably even across code refactoring. Develop CLI tools that interact with your users by using common input/output patterns, including environment variables and flags. Handle files to read or persist data, and manipulate paths consistently in cross-platform scenarios. Control processes and handle signals, and use a benchmark driven approach and Go's concurrency primitives to create tools that perform well. Use powerful external libraries such as Cobra to create modern and flexible tools that handle subcommands, and develop tools that interact with databases, APIs, and network services. Finally, leverage what you learned by tackling additional challenges at the end of each chapter. What You Need:  Go 1.8 or higher, an internet connection to download the example files and additional libraries, and a text editor to write your programs."

As a result, most users are not paying attention to the various manual aspects of Linux security. It is true that with Linux, you can automate many of your tasks. However, it also requires some manual touch for keeping everything with the pace. This fact even becomes more evident when it comes to the concept of security. Though an operating system might automate all your tasks, it is your task to be anxious always. You are required to keep a close eye on the settings of our application and various other details. When you have a well-configured Kali Linux system, it might turn out to be the most difficult thing to crack. However, most Kali Linux users do not have profound knowledge about what is required for keeping their whole systems locked up. If you start using a brand-new application, try to pay very close attention to its configuration details. Running the application with the same example settings and then using it is not the ideal option. It is not at all recommended. Some of the developers in the past also put decoy settings in the applications to make sure that the applications are prevented from running. This was a great way to ensure that all the users have checked out the file of a configuration of the application. When it comes to permissions, it forms an essential part of Linux. It is essential for a user to clearly understand how every permission functions and the implications of the various components of the OS. If you are shifting from Windows to Linux, the generalized concept might be a bit different and awkward for you. The general rule of Kali Linux is that you are not supposed to use root for your daily work. This might sound like a bit of a surprise for all the Windows users in which the operating system handles the various permissions, which are critical in nature in a different way. It is surely an inconvenient function to type a password each time you want the machine to execute a function. However, it is practical and will surely help prevent some serious security problems with your machine in the future. In this book, you will learn more about: Basic Linux commandsLinux InstallationFile SystemBasic Shell ProgrammingWhat to Do Next with Linux?Basic Kali Linux toolsCommand Syntax PatternsLinux Files and DirectoriesLinux File System SearchingUser and Group ManagementCommands and Functions for the BeginnerUsing Linux Text EditorsexercisesBuilding ScriptsSecuring Your Linux ServerGNU UtilitiesControl Privileged User...

That's because developers know that all the best features of your operating system are hidden behind a user interface designed to help average people use the computer. But you're not the average user, and the CLI is the most efficient way to get work done fast. Turn tedious chores into quick tasks: read and write files, manage complex directory hierarchies, perform network diagnostics, download files, work with APIs, and combine individual programs to create your own workflows. Put down that mouse, open the CLI, and take control of your software development environment. No matter what language or platform you're using, you can use the CLI to create projects, run servers, and manage files. You can even create new tools that fit right in with grep, sed, awk, and xargs. You'll work with the Bash shell and the most common command-line utilities available on macOS, Windows 10, and many flavors of Linux.Create files without opening a text editor. Manage complex directory strutures and move around your entire file system without touching the mouse. Diagnose network issues and interact with APIs. Chain several commands together to transform data, and create your own scripts to automate repetitive tasks. Make things even faster by customizing your environment, creating shortcuts, and integrating other tools into your environment. Hands-on activities and exercises will cement your newfound knowledge and give you the confidence to use the CLI to its fullest potential. And if you're worried you'll wreck your system, this book walks you through creating an Ubuntu virtual machine so you can practice worry-free.Dive into the CLI and join the thousands of other devs who use it every day.What You Need: You'll need macOS, Windows 10, or a Linux distribution like Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, or Debian using the Bash shell."

Modern computing relies on using a mouse and a nice GUI like those found on Windows PCs.

Before the modern GUI was introduced, users had greater flexibility and were able to give the computer specific commands for what to do. Programs were written at that level and launched the PC era. Just because Windows systems are so common, many people think they have no real choice, but that isn't so. Linux brings out the power of commands the same way the very first PCs functioned. The only challenge is how to actually start using Linux when you have never used it given that it seems to be simple to those who actually know it but a totally new world to those who don't. This book seeks to introduce you to the new world of using Linux to do literally anything you would want to do on your PC.
