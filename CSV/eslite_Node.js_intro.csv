The things that we can do on the web nowadays with JavaScript running on the server, as well as in the browser, were hard to imagine just several years ago, or were encapsulated within sandboxed environments like Flash or Java Applets.As Wikipedia states: ""Node.js is a packaged compilation of Google's V8 JavaScript engine, the libuv platform abstraction layer, and a core library, which is itself primarily written in JavaScript."" Beyond that, it's worth noting that Ryan Dahl, the creator of Node.js, was aiming to create real-time websites with push capability, ""inspired by applications like Gmail"". In Node.js, he gave developers a tool for working in the non-blocking, event-driven I/O paradigm.After over 20 years of stateless-web based on the stateless request-response paradigm, we finally have web applications with real-time, two-way connections.In one sentence: Node.js shines in real-time web applications employing push technology over websockets. What is so revolutionary about that? Well, after over 20 years of stateless-web based on the stateless request-response paradigm, we finally have web applications with real-time, two-way connections, where both the client and server can initiate communication, allowing them to exchange data freely. This is in stark contrast to the typical web response paradigm, where the client always initiates communication. Additionally, it's all based on the open web stack (HTML, CSS and JS) running over the standard port 80.One might argue that we've had this for years in the form of Flash and Java Applets-but in reality, those were just sandboxed environments using the web as a transport protocol to be delivered to the client. Plus, they were run in isolation and often operated over non-standard ports, which may have required extra permissions and such."

完整呈現阿里巴巴第一線Node開發者的經驗
JavaScript是能執行於前後端的程式語言，伴隨著Java、PHP與.NET等伺服端技術的風行，以及與前端瀏覽器的JavaScript越來越重要相比，伺服端JavaScript逐漸式微，不過，伺服端JavaScript現在又回來了，因為Node已誕生。
市面上的Node書籍大多停留在Node的介紹或者框架、程式庫等使用層面的初階知識，而本書則將從不同的視角來介紹Node內在的特點和結構，適合已瞭解Node基本知識、想深入了解Node觀念的您來閱讀。

9781484257371,"Explore what React, Node, TypeScript, Webpack, and Docker have to offer individually, and how they all fit together in modern app development. React is one of the most popular web development tools available today, and Node.js is extremely popular for server-side development. The fact that both utilize JavaScript is a big selling point, but as developers use the language more, they begin to recognize the shortcomings, and that's where TypeScript comes in and why it's gaining in popularity quickly. Add Webpack and Docker to the mix, and you've got a potent full development stack on which to build applications.You'll begin by building a solid foundation of knowledge and quickly expand it by constructing two different real-world apps. These aren't just simple, contrived examples but real apps that you can choose to install on your servers and use for real. By the end, you will have a solid grasp of building apps with React, Node.js, and TypeScript and a good grasp on how Webpack can be used to optimize and organize your code for deployment. You'll also understand how Docker can be used to run the apps you build in a clear and well-defined way, all of which will be able to springboard you into creating more advanced apps on your own.

9781730853937,"The Road to GraphQL is your personal journey to master pragmatic GraphQL in JavaScript. The book is full with applications you are going to build along the way with React.js and Node.js. Afterward, you will be able to implement full-stack JavaScript applications.I wrote the The Road to GraphQL over the last year, while building several GraphQL applications for my clients and for myself. During this time, I came to understand the practical genius of GraphQL, and how it dramatically improves communication in client-server architectures. Not only does it improve the interface between the client and the server, it also enhances client-side state management by eliminating remote data management. Sophisticated GraphQL libraries like Apollo Client provide powerful features like caching, optimistic UI, and data prefetching for free. This book covers the fundamentals of GraphQL itself, as well as its ecosystem. I applied the same principles as my other books: Stay pragmaticKeep it simpleAnswer the why, not just the howExperience a problem, solve a problemThis book is not intended to be an end-all reference for GraphQL APIs, nor an in-depth guide about the internals of the GraphQL specification. Instead, its purpose is to journey through learning GraphQL with JavaScript the pragmatic way, building client and server applications yourself. The book covers lots of facets about GraphQL in JavaScript that are important for building modern applications, without just throwing the libraries like Apollo at problems before experiencing them. It starts with the basic HTTP requests to perform GraphQL queries first, then moves on to using dedicated GraphQL libraries for it. You will even get the chance to implement your own GraphQL client library, so you understand how these libraries work under the hood. There are no hidden abstractions in this book, just plenty of fundamentals for JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, and GraphQL.RequirementsTo get the most out of this book, you should be familiar with the basics of web development, which includes some knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You will also need to be familiar with the term API, because they are discussed frequently. I encourage you to join the official Slack Group for the book, help or get help from others.ReactOn the client-side, this book uses React to teach about GraphQL in JavaScript. My other book called The Road to learn React teaches you all the fundamentals about React. It also teaches you to make the transition from JavaScript ES5 to JavaScript ES6. The book is available for free and after having read the Road to learn React, you should possess all the knowledge to implement the GraphQL client-side application with this book.NodeOn the server-side, this book uses Node with Express as library to teach about GraphQL in JavaScript. You don't need to know much about those technologies before using them for your first GraphQL powered applications. The book will guide you through the process of setting up a Node application with Express and shows you how to weave GraphQL into the mix. Afterward, you should be able to consume the GraphQL API provided by your server-side application in your client-side application."
