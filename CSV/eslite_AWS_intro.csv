Servers are stored on the Internet, allowing companies to handle data ""in the cloud"" instead of on a local server. It is a virtual space in which devices on the network can access data from anywhere. Amazon Web Services (AWS) Introduction to Famous Amazon Web Services is a robust cloud platform developed by Amazon's e-commerce giant. It offers software-as - a-Service (SaaS), platform-as - a-Service (PaaS), and infrastructure-as - a-Service (IaaS) services. Think about the history of the electricity supply to grasp the logic of AWS.Initially, factories will build their plants to fuel their facilities. Over time, governments and private investors have developed large power plants that supply electricity to numerous towns, factories, and homes. Under this new model, the factories will pay even less per unit of power due to the economies of scale enjoyed by the massive power plants. AWS was designed and built based on similar logic. This book covers the following topics:  - Cloud Concepts;- Security;- Technology;- Billing and pricing;- AWS Services. And Much More  By 2006, Amazon had established itself as the world's largest online retailer, a role it still holds. Seamlessly running such a vast operation required a large and sophisticated infrastructure. It imbued Amazon with deep expertise in the management of large-scale network and server networks. As a result, AWS was launched in 2006 as Amazon tried to make accessible to companies and individuals the technology infrastructure it had developed and the expertise it had gained.

9781789136722,"Identify tools and techniques to secure and perform a penetration test on an AWS infrastructure using Kali LinuxKey Features  Efficiently perform penetration testing techniques on your public cloud instances Learn not only to cover loopholes but also to automate security monitoring and alerting within your cloud-based deployment pipelines A step-by-step guide that will help you leverage the most widely used security platform to secure your AWS Cloud environment  Book Description The cloud is taking over the IT industry. Any organization housing a large amount of data or a large infrastructure has started moving cloud-ward -- and AWS rules the roost when it comes to cloud service providers, with its closest competitor having less than half of its market share. This highlights the importance of security on the cloud, especially on AWS. While a lot has been said (and written) about how cloud environments can be secured, performing external security assessments in the form of pentests on AWS is still seen as a dark art. This book aims to help pentesters as well as seasoned system administrators with a hands-on approach to pentesting the various cloud services provided by Amazon through AWS using Kali Linux. To make things easier for novice pentesters, the book focuses on building a practice lab and refining penetration testing with Kali Linux on the cloud. This is helpful not only for beginners but also for pentesters who want to set up a pentesting environment in their private cloud, using Kali Linux to perform a white-box assessment of their own cloud resources. Besides this, there is a lot of in-depth coverage of the large variety of AWS services that are often overlooked during a pentest -- from serverless infrastructure to automated deployment pipelines. By the end of this book, you will be able to identify possible vulnerable areas efficiently and secure your AWS cloud environment. What you will learn  Familiarize yourself with and pentest the most common external-facing AWS services Audit your own infrastructure and identify flaws, weaknesses, and loopholes Demonstrate the process of lateral and vertical movement through a partially compromised AWS account Maintain stealth and persistence within a compromised AWS account Master a hands-on approach to pentesting Discover a number of automated tools to ease the process of continuously assessing and improving the security stance of an AWS infrastructure  Who this book is for If you are a security analyst or a penetration tester and are interested in exploiting Cloud environments to reveal vulnerable areas and secure them, then this book is for you. A basic understanding of penetration testing, cloud computing, and its security concepts is mandatory."

This identity is called the AWS account root user and is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account. We strongly recommend that you do not use the root user for your everyday tasks, even the administrative ones.

1.以世界上目前最成功的雲端運算服務：「Amazon Web Services（AWS）」為主題，分享實際應用時的「可行策略」。2.分享作者長期使用AWS的經驗，包含遭遇到的各種問題與解決方法，並總評為何雲端運算仍然具有絕對優勢和商業利益。3.台灣第一本AWS實際應用方法的專書，由台灣作者以在地應用經驗撰寫，是企業改造、網站創業者必備書籍。
AWS（Amazon Web Services），目前世界上最成功的雲端運算服務，非常多新創網站或中小型企業透過AWS架設自己的雲端資料庫、網路應用系統，許多大型企業也會利用AWS架設企業內部的部份雲端功能，許多大型網路公司（例如twitter、zynga）也會利用AWS的優勢，快速更新自己的服務。
AWS可以理解為是主機代管、虛擬主機的雲端進化，也是現今最熱門的發展趨勢，它具有便宜、快速、穩定和充滿彈性的特色。相對於企業在自己公司內部設立實體主機，使用AWS雲端主機的第一個直接優點就是即使只有一個網管也有辦法勝任管理工作。
而相對於企業使用傳統主機代管，AWS的最大不同就是「雲端化」。簡單的說，不管是傳統主機、虛擬主機都還是從實體主機維護的思維出發，但是AWS是以「服務」的組合操作為核心精神，你只需要設定：我需要多少空間？多少流量？多少彈性？多少功能？我想要資料離哪一地區比較近？一設定完下一秒立刻生效，並且隨時可以調整，完全打破傳統實體主機申租的思維。
AWS是全球性的服務，非常適合網路創業、企業內部IT優化，而這本書將帶來中文世界的讀者一起進入AWS的雲端世界。"

9781949978018,"A recent industry report from Gartner points out that choices related to cloud computing at enterprises have changed from ""if"" to ""how"" to build, deploy, consume, manage, secure and integrate cloud services into their operations. The cloud solutions architect is the person who defines the enterprise cloud strategy from a technical point of view and must take responsibility for rolling out these cloud services.Cloud computing is a transformative paradigm that enables scalable, convenient, on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing and networking resources, for efficiently delivering applications and services over the Internet. Amazon Web Services (AWS), a leading provider of cloud platforms and services, defines a cloud solutions architect as one who can provide solution plans for the best architectural practices for cloud applications, can design and deploy highly scalable and fault-tolerant services, can assist in lifting legacy applications and shifting them to the cloud, and can identify and plan for data entry and exit from the cloud platform, choose suitable cloud services based on data, compute, and security requirements. Further, the cloud solutions architect also ensures that enterprise offerings conform to sound principles, such as AWS Well-Architected Framework (WAF) for cloud applications and services. We have written this textbook, as part of our expanding ""A Hands-On Approach""(TM) series, to meet this need at colleges and universities. This book is written as a textbook for training the next generation of cloud solutions architects for educational programs at colleges and universities, and also accompanying cloud certification programs where students would be interested in obtaining valuable hands-on skills on actual cloud platforms to further develop their knowledge and competency base. The typical reader is expected to have completed a couple of courses in programming using traditional high-level languages at the college level, and is either a senior or a beginning graduate student in one of the science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) fields. The reader is provided the necessary guidance and knowledge to develop working code for real-world cloud computing applications. Concurrent development of practical applications that accompanies traditional instructional material within the book further enhances the learning process, in our opinion. Furthermore, an accompanying website for this book (http: //hands-on-books-series.com) contains additional support for instruction and learning."
9780993088155,"This book will help you get started with AWS Lambda and the Serverless Application Model (SAM). Lambda is Amazon's engine for running event-driven functions, and SAM is an open-source toolkit that greatly simplifies configuring and deploying Lambda services. Together, they make it easy to create auto-scaling APIs and cloud services designed for serverless deployments. You'll learn how to:   Design applications that get the most out of serverless architecture Create auto-scaling web APIs Handle background tasks and messaging workflows Set up a deployment pipeline for effective team collaboration Test and troubleshoot code designed for AWS Lambda Inspect and monitor serverless applications  Running Serverless is a technical tutorial book. It will be useful for two groups of software developers and architects: people who have no previous experience working with serverless applications and are interested in learning about emerging cloud architectural patterns, and people who already work with Lambda using other deployment frameworks and want to learn about AWS SAM, the Serverless Application Model.   The contents of this book are based on author's experiences with MindMup, a collaborative mind-mapping system that was one of the early adopters of AWS Lambda. MindMup moved to a serverless model from an application hosting service throughout 2016, in order to benefit from on-demand scaling. We reduced operational costs by about two-thirds while significantly increasing application capacity, speeding up development and reducing time to market for new features.  This book is structured as a walk-through for building a practical application. We start from a simple static API and gradually grow it into an online image-resizing service, ready for millions of users, with all the supporting operational and infrastructural capabilities. The application closely resembles real-world systems that many of you will develop in your jobs. This will give you a good structure for your own work, and you will be able to almost copy parts to get a head start. As you discover how to create and deploy different parts of the application, you will also learn about key aspects of Lambda and related services, important tips, techniques and tools for running serverless.  The tutorial evolved from dozens of conference workshops and code camps. Gojko and his colleagues have used the exercises from this book to teach hundreds of developers about serverless architectures, improving the examples through feedback into a great way to gradually introduce important concepts."

But ever since, Amazon has expanded exponentially, inventing novel products like Alexa and disrupting countless industries, while its workforce has quintupled in size and its valuation has soared to well over a trillion dollars. Jeff Bezos’s empire, once housed in a garage, now spans the globe. Between services like Whole Foods, Prime Video, and Amazon’s cloud computing unit, AWS, plus Bezos’s ownership of The Washington Post, it’s impossible to go a day without encountering its impact. We live in a world run, supplied, and controlled by Amazon and its iconoclast founder.In Amazon Unbound, Brad Stone presents a deeply reported, vividly drawn portrait of how a retail upstart became one of the most powerful and feared entities in the global economy. With unprecedented access to current and former executives, employees, regulators, and critics, Stone shows how seismic changes inside the company over the past decade led to dramatic innovations, as well as to missteps that turned public sentiment against its sharp-elbowed business practices and gameshow treatment of its search for a second headquarters.Stone also probes the evolution of Bezos himself—who started as a geeky technologist totally devoted to building Amazon, but who transformed to become a fit, disciplined billionaire with global ambitions; who ruled Amazon with an iron fist, even as he found his personal life splashed over the tabloids. As his empire expands, the book investigates how Bezos gradually pulled away from day-to-day activities at Amazon to focus on his many interests outside of it, announcing his momentous transition from CEO to executive chairman.Definitive, timely, and revelatory, Stone has provided an unvarnished portrait of a man and company that we couldn’t imagine modern life without."
