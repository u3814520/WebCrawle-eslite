Bring all the power of Transact-SQL (T-SQL) and Microsoft .NET to bear on your repetitive data, data integration, and ETL processes. Do this for no added cost over what you've already spent on licensing SQL Server. The tools and methods from this book may be applied to on-premises and Azure SQL Server instances. The SSIS framework from this book works in Azure Data Factory (ADF) and provides DevOps personnel the ability to execute child packages outside a project--functionality not natively available in SSIS.Frameworks not only reduce the time required to deliver enterprise functionality, but can also accelerate troubleshooting and problem resolution. You'll learn in this book how frameworks also improve code quality by using metadata to drive processes. Much of the work performed by data professionals can be classified as ""drudge work""--tasks that are repetitive and template-based. The frameworks-based approach shown in this book helps you to avoid that drudgery by turning repetitive tasks into ""one and done"" operations. Frameworks as described in this book also support enterprise DevOps with built-in logging functionality.

MDM gives organizations a way to configure settings that achieve their administrative intent without exposing every possible setting. One benefit of MDM is that it enables organizations to apply broader privacy, security, and application management settings through lighter and more efficient tools. MDM also allows organizations to target Internet-connected devices to manage policies without using Group Policy (GP) that requires on-premises domain-joined devices. This makes MDM the best choice for devices that are constantly on the go.

9780131582316,"“Explaining the intersection of these two worlds--service-orientation and .NET technologies--is exactly what this book does. Its team of specialist authors provides a concrete, usable guide to this combination, ranging from the fundamentals of service-orientation to the more rarified air of .NET services in the cloud and beyond. If you’re creating service-oriented software on the Microsoft platform--that is, if you’re a serious .NET developer--mastering these ideas is a must.”   --From the Foreword by David Chappell, Chappell & Associates      “Microsoft’s diverse product line has long supported the service-oriented enterprise, but putting it all together into a cohesive whole can be daunting. From more established products, like Windows Communication Foundation, Windows Workflow Foundation, Microsoft Office SharePoint Server, and BizTalk Server, to newer offerings like Windows Azure and AppFabric, the experts assembled here expose the sweet spots for each technology, talk through the high-level trade-offs, and offer a roadmap to a unified Microsoft SOA story.”   --Kevin P. Davis, Ph.D., Software Architect      “This book excels in giving hands-on and in-depth expertise on the SOA architecture style with the .NET framework and the Azure cloud platform. It’s a practical guide for developers, architects, and SOA implementers. A must read!”    --Ricardo P. Schluter, ICT Architect,  Parnassia Bavo Group      “While the industry overall may have hyped ‘the cloud’ to the level it often seems to cure world hunger, SOA with .NET and Windows Azure helps cut through the questions and hype and more clearly discusses the benefits and practical techniques for putting it to work in the real world. This book helps you understand the benefits associated with SOA and cloud computing, and also the techniques for connecting your current IT assets with new composite applications and data running in the cloud. This book will help you understand modern middleware technologies and harness the benefits of the cloud both on and off premises.”     --Burley Kawasaki, Director of Product Management, Microsoft      “The authors have a combined SOA and .NET experience of several decades–which becomes obvious when reading this book. They don’t just lead you down one path with a single descriptive solution. Instead, the sometimes nasty trade-offs that architects face in their design decisions are addressed. These are then mapped to the Microsoft .NET platform with clear code examples. A very refreshing look at this major contender in the SOA space and a definite must for the .NET SOA practitioner!”   --Dr. Thomas Rischbeck, IT Architect, Innovation Process Technology      “In order to evolve as a software craftsman one must read excellent books that will help you grow and evolve in your profession. One of those books that every software craftsmen interested in good design and best practices should read is SOA with .NET and Windows Azure. With this book, you will learn which design patterns will provide the best solution for the kinds of software design problems you, as a developer or designer, face every day. This book has everything that software architects, software designers, and programmers need to know when building great quality software with Microsoft technologies.     “This will undoubtedly be one of those books that you reference repeatedly when starting new SOA projects. There is plenty of information that even those not working with typical service-oriented architecture will find very useful. With plenty of real-life examples (code, design, and modeling), readers see in a practical manner how they could use SOA patterns to solve everyday software problems and be more productive. SOA with .NET and Windows Azure will fit in my top three books and will definitely be one of those that I will use in my everyday work.”    --Arman Kurtagic, Consultant at Omegapoint AB        The Authoritative Guide to Building Service-Oriented Solutions with Microsoft .NET Technologies and the Windows Azure Cloud Computing Platform   In SOA with .NET and Windows Azure, top Microsoft technology experts team up with Thomas Erl to explore service-oriented computing with Microsoft’s latest .NET service technologies and Windows Azure innovations.     The authors provide comprehensive documentation of on-premise and cloud-based modern service technology advancements within the Microsoft platform and further show how these technologies have increased the potential for applying and realizing service-orientation practices and goals.     Specifically, the book delves into Microsoft enterprise technologies, such as:      Windows Communication Foundation (WCF)    Windows Azure    Windows Workflow Foundation (WF)    Windows Azure AppFabric    BizTalk Server    Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)    ...as well as industry service mediums, including WS-* and REST, and many related service industry standards and technologies.     The book steps through common SOA design patterns and service-orientation principles, along with numerous code-level examples that further detail various technology architectures and implementations.      Topic Areas   This book covers the following primary topics:      Microsoft Service Technologies     Microsoft Enterprise Technologies     On-Premise & Cloud-Based Service Topics     Industry Service Technologies & Mediums     Service-Oriented Technology Architectural Models     Service-Orientation Design Paradigm     Service-Orientation Design Principles     SOA Design Patterns        About the Web Sites   This book series is further supported by a series of resources sites, including:      www.soabooks.com    www.soaspecs.com    www.soamag.com    www.serviceorientation.com      www.soapatterns.org     www.soaprinciples.com    www.whatissoa.com        "

4712765168289,◎【穿著Prada的惡魔】【六呎風雲】插曲夢幻民謠雙人組全新專輯◎成軍十年唯美蛻變，迷離電氣頻率與夢幻民謠的浪漫交會◎深受James Blake、Nicolas Jaar與Apparat啟發的電氣化聲響有時，當早晨的陽光射穿窗簾時，驚醒後的我們會突然一陣感傷，驚訝著時間從何而去；或者，發現街角熟悉的某家老店突然改頭換面，我們也會因昨是今非而感到惆悵，彷彿從此遺失了過去。在人生百忙之中所抽離出的魔幻時刻，總是讓人想起Azure Ray的音樂。由Maria Taylor及Orenda Fink所組成的Dream Pop樂團Azure Ray，自2001年發行首張同名專輯以來，曲風始終遊走在民謠與電氣間，以如夢似幻的甜美聲線，輕易就映射出我們人生中的魔幻時刻。新作《As Above So Below》曲風試圖往更電氣化且迷離的方向靠攏，雖僅收錄六首歌曲，聽完卻讓人意猶未盡。〈Scattered Like Leaves〉與〈Red Balloon〉可聽見甜美夢幻的歌聲堆疊在低緩的電氣重拍下；〈Unannounced〉裡效果器製造出的扭曲歪斜聲音，就像是一抹最深情感傷的凝視；以內斂低迴的鋼琴聲串起傷感情緒的〈The Heart Has Its Reasons〉，即是Azure Ray的招牌Dream Pop曲風，彷彿一腳踏入蒼白唯美的夢境；到了〈We Could Wake〉一曲則又是一場黑暗中的漫舞。在Azure Ray映射出的魔幻時刻裡，如果看見那些生命中溜走的東西，就算再也不能擁有了，也務必要好好記住它。
4712765165783,"原來，心碎與寂寞也能如斯和煦動人◎美國獨立領域最美麗聲音，睽違七年浪漫回歸◎【穿著PRADA的惡魔】插曲夢幻民謠樂隊最新專輯◎台灣特別盤超值加收兩首B-Side單曲一對15歲便在阿拉巴馬藝術學院相遇的女孩Maria Taylor和Orenda Fink， 2001年開始以Azure Ray為名發表作品後，隨即獲獨立大明星Conor Oberst（Bright Eye）網羅至所屬廠牌Saddle Creek旗下，以夾帶著田園氣息的精巧夢幻民謠，帶來三張叫好叫座的專輯與〈Rise〉、〈4th of July〉等惹人心碎的經典單曲，成為美國獨立領域最美麗聲音。2004年為專注於個人音樂創作， Azure Ray悄悄劃下休止符，直至2009年再度展開巡迴，並於今年推出樂迷望穿秋水的新作。《Drawing Down The Moon》無暇地銜接著《Hold on Love》灑落的低調恬靜，彷彿近七年的時光也為Azure Ray的缺席而靜止，長期合作夥伴Eric Bachmann依舊擔綱製作，將前作的電氣化傾向焠鍊出更加浪漫的質地，從優雅豎琴編織的完美序曲〈Wake Up, Sleepyhead〉開始，首支單曲〈Don't Leave My Mind〉脫俗雅致的透徹電子節拍，〈Silver Sorrow〉和〈Love And Permanence〉的迷濛電氣民謠，一直到〈Signs In The Leaves〉和〈Larraine〉樸質的田園氣息，招牌的澄澈清新合聲下，Azure Ray訴說著愛情與生活的痛楚與惆悵，看似雲淡風輕，卻總能輕易凝結空氣、挑動善感的靈魂。宛如夜空閃爍的微光，忽明忽滅，一不留意，它們便會羞澀地躲進深沉的黑暗裡頭，這款屬於Azure Ray獨有的靜謐精巧氣質，不若多數Dream Pop那樣有著令人一見傾心的夢幻甜美，歪斜的美麗留白，用簡約的吉他、鋼琴、弦樂和合成音效，悄悄堆積起極度貼近人心的親暱寂寥感，是需要時間蘊釀、累積的情緒，然而，當你一踩進那片蒼白唯美，便會徹底迷失在那失去時間標記的世界。"

4712765169590,夢幻民謠指標Azure Ray成員回歸初衷第六張創作大碟長期夢幻搭檔Mike Mogis、Andy LeMaster再次站台傾力相助一張集結親人、同窗好友共同於車庫完成的質樸歌謠集 旅人，終究還是要回家的；只不過「家」的定義因人而異，但至少對於Maria Taylor來說，家是旅人疲累身心的歸宿，能令她短暫歇息後重拾信心，也是她寫意詞句底下，生活最原始的風貌。歷經Azure Ray的青春「電幻」、Bright Eyes的一段才子佳人情，Maria Taylor個人第六張大碟《Something About Knowing》實在已沒什麼包袱，也沒什麼瓶頸好需要去突破的，於是曲子爽朗清新、嗓音充滿幸福的愉悅感，完全反應於唱片封面底下的閒情逸致。 上張大碟《Overlook》初嘗監製唱片的重任，從歌手的身份轉換至製作人，Maria Taylor重拾創作上的信心。新專輯《Something About Knowing》於她最熟悉的「家」裡完成，專輯內10首歌曲皆是利用兒子午睡時刻與閒雜時間裡寫下，再次找來Bright Eyes製作人Andy LeMaster為她混音，Rachael Yamagata製作人Mike Mogis與她一同製作。錄音與demo的練習地點也移至車庫進行，Maria Tayor的哥哥Macey Taylor也在專輯裡客串貝斯演奏，而中學時的音樂伙伴Brad Armstrong則成了這次專輯的最佳搭檔。 歌曲〈A Lullaby For You〉、〈Sum of Our Lives〉是Maria Taylor對生活周遭的描寫與最直接的感觸，也是她獻給家人（尤其兒子）的禮物；帶點嬉皮味的〈Up All Night〉有別於過往夢幻氣息，顯露出Maria Taylor直率的性格；而〈Folk Song Melody〉則是Maria Taylor的拿手好戲，纖弱的嗓音裡帶著一份自信的篤定，直截了當的敘事民謠曲風，頗有Jenny Lewis的神韻。 《Something About Knowing》所寫所唱的可能是我們再熟悉不過的Azure Ray或Maria Taylor，卻是她忙裡偷閒逐一記錄下的生活點滴，沒有多餘的造作與矯情。（OR）伊森
