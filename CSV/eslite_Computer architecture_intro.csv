9781681739847,"This book reviews the application of machine learning in system-wide simulation and run-time optimization, and in many individual components such as caches/memories, branch predictors, networks-on-chip, and GPUs. Artificial intelligence has already enabled pivotal advances in diverse fields, yet its impact on computer architecture has only just begun. In particular, recent work has explored broader application to the design, optimization, and simulation of computer architecture. Notably, machine-learning-based strategies often surpass prior state-of-the-art analytical, heuristic, and human-expert approaches.The book further analyzes current practice to highlight useful design strategies and identify areas for future work, based on optimized implementation strategies, opportune extensions to existing work, and ambitious long term possibilities. Taken together, these strategies and techniques present a promising future for increasingly automated computer architecture designs."

9780970112477,"Learn computer architecture and get practical ""hands on"" experience using an FPGA while studying at home. A working model of a 32-bit ARM processor is gradually built from basic principals of computer architecture. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) provide flexible digital electronics platforms that can be organized as a CPU, a neural net, or almost any other digital circuit. They are the digital equivalent of shape-shifters in science fiction.The FPGA is first introduced graphically through operational models of individual logic gates and structures like buses and decoders. Next, the Verilog coding begins with simple circuit examples and culminates with a CPU that runs ARM machine code. Programs can even be entered in symbolic assembly language which is compiled into 100% ARM machine code by macros, tasks, and functions written in the Verilog language. This CPU imitation can be run at full speed, stepped through with breakpoints, or paused within the fetch, decode, and execute cycle.Over 150 illustrations accompany detailed descriptions for setting up the FPGA and walking through each of the nearly 100 Verilog examples. All source code examples can be downloaded from GitHub and use the Intel(R) Quartus(R) Prime software along with a Terasic DE10-Lite FPGA development board. The DE10-Lite is available for purchase for less than $100 at many Internet sites, and the Intel(R) Quartus(R) Prime Lite Edition is available as a free download from Intel. Other FPGA boards and other Verilog software can be used, but slight modifications to the examples may be necessary."

9798618861229,"The objective of this book is to make it possible (and even easy) for students to master both assembly language and the fundamentals of computer architecture in a single semester. Integrating coverage of software and hardware throughout, the book uses H1--a simple, horizontally microprogrammed computer--as a unifying theme. Like all simple models, H1 has flaws, but this book puts these flaws to good use. In particular, in addition to showing students how H1 works and what is wrong with it, the book shows students how to fix it (which they then proceed to do). Students learn best by doing, and this book supplies much to do with various examples and projects to facilitate learning. For example, students not only use assemblers and linkers, they also write their own. Students not only study and use the provided instruction set but implement new, improved ones. The result is a book that is easy to read, engaging, and substantial. The software package for the book supports Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and Raspbian."
