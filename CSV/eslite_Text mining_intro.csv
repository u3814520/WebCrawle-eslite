This book teaches you R (R can be downloaded for free), People Analytics, Social Media Analytics, Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis. It is written for people with absolutely NO knowledge of R programming, with step-by-step print-screen instructions. The sample R codes are kept simple, short & straightforward so that you are not overwhelmed with too much unnecessary information, and focuses on the R codes relevant to people analytics, so that you'll be up-and-running in no time. If you are new to R programming, this is the book for you. As R is developed specially for statistical analysis, you can run complicated statistical number crunching (Correlation, Multiple & Logistic Regression, etc.) by simply entering a few commands. This book covers a wide People Analytics scope (Benefits, Compensation, Culture, Diversity & Inclusion, Engagement, Leadership, Learning & Development, Personality Traits, Performance Management, Recruitment, Sales Incentives) with numerous real-world examples, and shows how People Analytics with R can help you 1) Run Social Media Analytics, Text mining & Sentiment Analysis with R. 2) Predict employees' flight-risk using R's Correlation & Logistic Regression function. 3) Identify the personality traits of top performing Customer Service staff and Sales staff using R's correlation function.4) Predict impact of Employee Engagement on Customer Satisfaction, Revenue and Shareholder Returns, etc. using R's Correlation & Multiple Regression function. 5) Predict impact of Learning & Development on Sales, using R's Multiple Regression function.6) Predict Diversity & Inclusion's impact on Revenue and EBIT using R's Multiple Regression function. You'll be taught how to convert your company's ethnicity diversity mix (70% Chinese: 20% Malay: 10% Indian) to an index number (e.g. diversity index of 2.7), then use R's Multiple Regression to predict your company sales, if your company's ""diversity Index"" is 2.7 and if you spend $90 on advertising."

9781491981658,"Much of the data available today is unstructured and text-heavy, making it challenging for analysts to apply their usual data wrangling and visualization tools. With this practical book, you'll explore text-mining techniques with tidytext, a package that authors Julia Silge and David Robinson developed using the tidy principles behind R packages like ggraph and dplyr. You'll learn how tidytext and other tidy tools in R can make text analysis easier and more effective.The authors demonstrate how treating text as data frames enables you to manipulate, summarize, and visualize characteristics of text. You'll also learn how to integrate natural language processing (NLP) into effective workflows. Practical code examples and data explorations will help you generate real insights from literature, news, and social media.Learn how to apply the tidy text format to NLPUse sentiment analysis to mine the emotional content of textIdentify a document's most important terms with frequency measurementsExplore relationships and connections between words with the ggraph and widyr packagesConvert back and forth between R's tidy and non-tidy text formatsUse topic modeling to classify document collections into natural groupsExamine case studies that compare Twitter archives, dig into NASA metadata, and analyze thousands of Usenet messages"
