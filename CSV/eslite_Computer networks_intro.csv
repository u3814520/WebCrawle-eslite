This book is timely and relevant towards accomplishing these lofty goals. -- From the foreword by Dr. Anima Anandkumar, Bren Professor, Caltech, and Director of ML Research, NVIDIA Ekman uses a learning technique that in our experience has proven pivotal to success--asking the reader to think about using DL techniques in practice. His straightforward approach is refreshing, and he permits the reader to dream, just a bit, about where DL may yet take us. -- From the foreword by Dr. Craig Clawson, Director, NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute Deep learning (DL) is a key component of today's exciting advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Learning Deep Learning is a complete guide to DL. Illuminating both the core concepts and the hands-on programming techniques needed to succeed, this book is ideal for developers, data scientists, analysts, and others--including those with no prior machine learning or statistics experience. After introducing the essential building blocks of deep neural networks, such as artificial neurons and fully connected, convolutional, and recurrent layers, Magnus Ekman shows how to use them to build advanced architectures, including the Transformer. He describes how these concepts are used to build modern networks for computer vision and natural language processing (NLP), including Mask R-CNN, GPT, and BERT. And he explains how a natural language translator and a system generating natural language descriptions of images. Throughout, Ekman provides concise, well-annotated code examples using TensorFlow with Keras. Corresponding PyTorch examples are provided online, and the book thereby covers the two dominating Python libraries for DL used in industry and academia. He concludes with an introduction to neural architecture search (NAS), exploring important ethical issues and providing resources for further learning.  Explore and master core concepts: perceptrons, gradient-based learning, sigmoid neurons, and back propagation See how DL frameworks make it easier to develop more complicated and useful neural networks Discover how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) revolutionize image classification and analysis Apply recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to text and other variable-length sequences Master NLP with sequence-to-sequence networks and the Transformer architecture Build applications for natural language translation and image captioning  NVIDIA's invention of the GPU sparked the PC gaming market. The company's pioneering work in accelerated computing--a supercharged form of computing at the intersection of computer graphics, high-performance computing, and AI--is reshaping trillion-dollar industries, such as transportation, healthcare, and manufacturing, and fueling the growth of many others.

Does the word ""hacker"" make you think of the cool kids who don't obey society's rules?  Or does the idea of someone hacking your system and stealing your data make you break out into a cold sweat?  Do you want to understand how hacking works for once and for all?  If the answer to any of these questions is yes, this book will provide you with the answers you've been looking for   What might come as a surprise to you is that hacking does not need to mean having mad computer skills. You need to know some basics, naturally, but hacking a computer system is a lot simpler than you might think. And there are a lot of software and tools out there that can help you grow from a hacking novice to a hacking expert in a very short period of time.  The truth is that no system is ever truly 100% safe. Most systems have coding errors that make them more vulnerable to attack simply for the reason that programmers have to rush to get the latest apps, etc. to market before anyone else does. It is only when there is a glitch or when the system is actually hacked that these errors are even found. And, if the hacker wants to maintain access to the system, they will work at hiding these vulnerabilities from everyone else so they might never come to light.  And passwords are not the ultimate answer either. Even the strongest passwords can be cracked if you have the right software and enough time.  If you want to learn how to beat a hacker at their own game, you need to start thinking as they do.  And what about if you are more interested in the other side of the coin? Becoming the hacker and avoiding detection? Well, this book looks at things from both sides of the equation. You need to learn how to be a hacker yourself if you really want to be effective at beating other hackers. How you use the information provided is up to you at the end of the day.  It can be a rollercoaster that will sometimes have you wondering if you have the stuff to make it. But I can promise you one thing. Whether you are the hacker or are working to prevent a system being hacked, you are guaranteed an interesting ride.  When hacking a system depends on buying yourself enough time to allow the password cracker to do its work, or when it means outsmarting someone on the other end of the line, it can be a real adrenaline rush.  Being a successful hacker is about using the right tools for the right job and, ultimately, being the smartest person in that battle. Do you have what it takes? Why not read on and see?
