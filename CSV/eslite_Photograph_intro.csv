9781664180239,"Taiwan, also called the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan, has remained a place not too well known to westerners. With a population of 25 million, Taiwan is the seventh largest economy in Asia and the 20th largest economy in the world. Yet there is much more to Taiwan than just the size of its economy, or that the Taiwanese are among the most affluent in Asia. Taiwan is an island of climate contrasts, a country with a rich culture going back centuries, and with vibrant major cities like Taipei, Tainan and Taichung City (as described in the book). It is a country with a mountainous inter-land, many rural farming villages, and tropical rain forests. Taiwan's people include the Austronesians (the first people to set foot in Taiwan), immigrants from Fujian province (the province opposite of Taiwan), many Chinese immigrants from northern China (who brought Mandarin), and the Hakka. The most important religions are Buddhism, Taoism and native Chinese ancestor worship. For the world traveler, or for an expatriate living there, Taiwan is worth exploring and knowing."
9781664172517,"For some Americans, when they think of the Republic of Korea (popularly called South Korea), they think of the Korean War fought so long ago. Many younger Americans, when they think of South Korea, think of K-pop, the big corporations Samsung, Hyundai, LG and Kia, and the cars these corporations have produced over the decades. But this is only one small aspect of a country with a rich history and culture few Americans know. Many Americans have not heard of, for example, the ancient City of Gyeongju with its surviving relics and monuments that were part of a once great kingdom. Then there is the Korean alphabet known as hangul, which was an invention to help facilitate all Koreans to be able to read and write in their language. My book is an exploration of some of these palaces, temples, churches and famous places in South Korea. More than that, my photographic memoir also looks at the things that make Korea what it is, and the dynamism behind the Korean people who have in their own way greatly contributed to our world."

9781944866372,"This girl is hungry for the weight of a camera in her hands, but that desire feels wicked. Is it because her father is a war photographer and photography has always been his domain? Or is it because she's yet to become a woman who chases what she wants? And who's to say photography can't be her domain, too? At least she knows this: Salvation lies in pixels. Heaven is a photograph.This collection of narrative poems and photographs tells the story of an art student and her journey of doubt, longing, and questioning. Join her as she finds her power behind the lens.""With Heaven is a Photograph, Christine Sloan Stoddard presents you with a poetic meditation on the fear and desire of making images (and claiming one's power). Intellectually and spiritually rich, her words and images imprint on your mind and heart with beauty, honesty and recognition.""-Art Jones, artist and filmmaker""Heaven is a Photograph is a living hagiography of a girl who cannot decide whether or not pursuing photography is a sin. Conflicted by gender expectations and the uncertainty of a career in the arts, the one thing that the protagonist knows is that photography is a deeply spiritual practice, enveloping her life. It is truly an autobiography of many women in the arts.""-Gretchen Gales, executive editor of Quail Bell Magazine, as seen in Ms. Magazine, The Mighty, and Roar Feminist Magazine""Heaven is a Photograph is a unique exploration of poetry and photography you'll only experience through Christine Sloan Stoddard's magic.

Through the lens of her viewpoint character, the collection demonstrates the personal and universal appeal of photography in a vivid and impactful manner. Stoddard describes the art of photography as it relates to memory, creation, and legacy in a way that makes the act of clicking the shutter button both an artistic and a spiritual act.""-Alex Carrigan, senior critic at Quail Bell Magazine""The narrator of Christine Stoddard's Heaven is a Photograph is hungry. For art. For success. For salvation. For the weight of a camera in her hands. She laments that photography is slow to love her back, which is perhaps what makes this collection so intoxicating. The unchecked, sometimes fearful and unabashedly female desire of a woman who cannot contain her passion-who would let it consume her-explodes in words and images.""-Mari Pack, author of Description of a New World (dancing girl press)"
9781681985459,"Learn to ask better, more helpful questions of your work so that you can create stronger and more powerful photographs.Photographers often look at an image--one they've either already created or are in the process of making--and ask themselves a simple question: ""Is this a good photograph?"" It's an understandable question, but it's really not very helpful. How are you supposed to answer that? What does ""good"" even mean? Is it the same for everyone?What if you were equipped to ask better, more constructive questions of your work so that you could think more intentionally and creatively, and in doing so, bring more specific action and vision to the act of creating photographs? What if asking stronger questions allowed you to establish a more effective approach to your image-making? In The Heart of the Photograph: 100 Questions for Making Stronger, More Expressive Photographs, photographer and author David duChemin helps you learn to ask better questions of your work in order to craft more successful photographs--photographs that express and connect, photographs that are strong and, above all, photographs that are truly yours.From the big-picture questions--What do I want this image to accomplish?--to the more detail-oriented questions that help you get there--What is the light doing? Where do the lines lead? What can I do about it?--David walks you through his thought process so that you can establish your own. Along the way, he discusses the building blocks from which compelling photographs are made, such as gesture, balance, scale, contrast, perspective, story, memory, symbolism, and much more.

9781250173645,"Through the story of Tamara, an abused Native American child, North Dakota Senator Byron Dorgan describes the plight of many children living on reservations--and offers hope for the future.  On a winter morning in 1990, U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota picked up the Bismarck Tribune. On the front page, a small Native American girl gazed into the distance, shedding a tear. The headline: Foster home children beaten--and nobody's helping.  Dorgan, who had been working with American Indian tribes to secure resources, was upset. He flew to the Standing Rock Indian Reservation to meet with five-year-old Tamara who had suffered a horrible beating at a foster home. He visited with Tamara and her grandfather and they became friends. Then Tamara disappeared. And he would search for her for decades until they finally found each other again.  This book is her story, from childhood to the present, but it's also the story of a people and a nation. More than one in three American Indian/Alaskan Native children live in poverty. AI/AN children are disproportionately in foster care and awaiting adoption. Suicide among AI/AN youth ages 15 to 24 is 2.5 times the national rate. How has America allowed this to happen?  As distressing a situation as it is, this is also a story of hope and resilience. Dorgan, who founded the Center for Native American Youth (CNAY) at the Aspen Institute, has worked tirelessly to bring Native youth voices to the forefront of policy discussions, engage Native youth in leadership and advocacy, and secure and share resources for Native youth. You will fall in love with this heartbreaking story, but end the book knowing what can be done and what you can do."

Photographers, like all artists, stand on the shoulders of those who came before them, and they are informed and influenced by those working around them. If you are striving to find your own style, one of the most powerful exercises you can practice is to find influence and inspiration in the work of those around you, and then emulate that work in an effort to define, shape, and grow your own photographic voice. By collecting, imitating, and eventually reshaping and combining the work of those around you, your unique voice can be found and the quality of your work can soar.In Photograph Like a Thief, photographer, author, and retoucher Glyn Dewis embraces the idea of ""stealing"" and recreating others' work in order to improve as an artist. By stepping inside others' images, you can learn to reverse engineer their creation, then build an image that simultaneously pays homage to that work and is also an original creation itself.Glyn begins by covering the process of stealing ideas and finding inspiration. He shares the gear he uses as well as his retouching and post-processing workflow. In a chapter on how to reverse engineer a photograph, Glyn discusses how to read an image by looking at the catch lights, shadow and highlight positions, and the hardness or softness of the shadows. This is a crucial skill to acquire if you want to recreate a specific look.Glyn then works through a series of images--inspired by movies, books, history, and a few legendary photographers--from the initial concept and influence to the final result. For each image, he reverse engineers the shot to describe how it was created, then works through the gear he used, the lighting for the image, and the post-processing of the image in Photoshop--from the RAW out-of-camera shot to the finished piece. While Glyn's work primarily focuses on portraiture, he finds inspiration and influence from a wide variety of work.By working alongside Glyn (he makes all the files available for download), you too can learn to find inspiration all around you, discover how others' work can influence you, improve your photographic and post-processing skill set, and begin your own journey to defining your unique style.Who knows?

9780544828698,"A single photograph--an exceptionally rare ""action shot"" documenting the horrific final moment of the murder of a family--drives a riveting process of discovery for a gifted Holocaust scholar In 2009, the acclaimed author of Hitler's Furies was shown a photograph just brought to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. The documentation of the Holocaust is vast, but there are virtually no images of a Jewish family at the actual moment of murder, in this case by German officials and Ukrainian collaborators. A Ukrainian shooter's rifle is inches from a woman's head, obscured in a cloud of smoke. She is bending forward, holding the hand of a barefooted little boy. And--only one of the shocking revelations of Wendy Lower's brilliant ten-year investigation of this image--the shins of another child, slipping from the woman's lap.  Wendy Lower's forensic and archival detective work--in Ukraine, Germany, Slovakia, Israel, and the United States--recovers astonishing layers of detail concerning the open-air massacres in Ukraine. The identities of mother and children, of the killers--and, remarkably, of the Slovakian photographer who openly took the image, as a secret act of resistance--are dramatically uncovered. Finally, in the hands of this brilliant exceptional scholar, a single image unlocks a new understanding of the place of the family unit in the ideology of Nazi genocide.   "

9780190923815,"In January 1942, Soviet press photographers came upon a scene like none they had ever documented. That day, they took pictures of the first liberation of a German mass atrocity, where an estimated 7,000 Jews and others were executed at an anti-tank trench near Kerch on the Crimean peninsula.Dmitri Baltermants, a photojournalist working for the Soviet newspaper Izvestiia,  took photos that day that would have a long life in shaping the image of Nazi genocide in and against the Soviet Union. Presenting never before seen photographs, Grief: The Biography of a Holocaust Photograph shows howBaltermants used the image of a grieving woman to render this gruesome mass atrocity into a transcendentally human tragedy. David Shneer tells the story of how that one photograph from the series Baltermants took that day in 1942 near Kerch became much more widely known than the others, eventually being titled Grief. Baltermants turned this shocking wartime atrocity photograph into a Cold War era artistic meditation onthe profundity and horror of war that today can be found in Holocaust photo archives as well as in art museums and at art auctions. Although the journalist documented murdered Jews in other pictures he took at Kerch, in Grief there are likely no Jews among the dead or the living, save for thepossible NKVD soldier securing the site. Nonetheless, Shneer shows that this photograph must be seen as an iconic Holocaust photograph. Unlike images of emaciated camp survivors or barbed wire fences, Shneer argues, the Holocaust by bullets in the Soviet Union make Grief a quintessential Sovietimage of Nazi genocide."

Knowing a wild palomino was rare, Robbins sent for photographerVerne Wood to capture the animal on film.Forty years later, a question from a daughter to her father about that very photograph would set the man on a sixteen-year journey to find the truth. He would discover that Woods took a one-in-a-million photograph; one that won a prestigious contest, the winning of which set the horse-and the two men-on a rollercoaster ride toward destiny. As the photo gained fame worldwide-appearing in the Wyoming State Capitol, the United States Senate Chambers, the House of Commons in London, and the Canadian Parliament in Toronto-the horse became the star of a film nominated for an Academy Award. All while Robbins and Wood battled for ownership of the photo and its copyrighted name, resulting in one of the most unique Solomonesque rulings ever handed down by a court.What started out as a passion, soon became an obsession to uncover the entire truth-or at least as close to the truth as any one man could come. With over 150 photos, Desert Dust follows Gill Gillilan's investigation into one of the most famous horses in the American West. It is a story of highs and lows, victory and defeat, frailty and strength. It contains one of the most unique cast of characters ever assembled, including the stallion that ended up a supporting actor in his own life story. "

When Esquire magazine planned an issue to salute the American jazz scene in 1958, graphic designer Art Kane pitched a crazy idea: how about gathering a group of beloved jazz musicians and photographing them?

In a captivating collection of poems, Roxane Orgill steps into the frame of Harlem 1958,  bringing to life the musicians' mischief and quirks, their memorable style, and the vivacious atmosphere of a Harlem block full of kids on a hot summer's day.

9783791355047,"An unparalleled exploration of the art of cameraless photography, this expansive book offers an authoritative and lavishly illustrated history of photography made without a camera, along with a critical discussion of the practice..Since the early 19th century and the invention of photography, artists have been experimenting with various methods for creating photographs without a camera. At once exhaustive and compelling, this book reveals the myriad approaches artists have used to create photographic images using just paper and a source of radiation. Simultaneously a chronological history and a thematic study, this book explores a range of practices, some of which have been in use for more than a century, while others are entirely contemporary. From placing objects on light-sensitive paper and drawing on blackened glass plates to radiography, photocopying, and digital scanning, this is an elemental kind of photography that repudiates the idea that technology advances in only one direction. By eliminating the camera, artists are able to focus on other ways of making photographic pictures. They allow the world to leave its own imprint, to speak for itself as itself. This volume includes 160 exquisitely reproduced works of this kind. In turns abstract and realist, haunting and intricate, they seem to capture the very essence of their subjects. Featuring artists from the 19th century to today, this book explores cameraless photography as an important and influential medium that deserves to be included at the forefront of today s conversations about contemporary art."

With substantive clarity, she explains time travel, portals, dowsing, negative and positive vortexes, balls of energy known as merkabahs, ley lines, and orbs-the plasma of some life form visible to human eyes or to cameras, many of which are nature spirits who enjoy being around happy energy and so are often seen at parties and spiritual gatherings.A professional interdimensional communicator, Atala is up to the minute in her understanding of the emerging field of spiritual sciences and the correlations between modern physics and ancient metaphysical traditions that perceive the oneness of all nature. We all communicate interdimensionally every day, she says. We just don't know it, and so we lose out on the many ways to receive help from the other life forms who share our space. Drawing on her own and her clients' experiences, she teaches through colorful stories and her own powerful photographs. Titles include The Ghost Who Washed Dishes, The Haunted Hotel, The Guardian of the Spring, The Horse Who Knew More Than His Owners, The Jilted House, The Stranded Gnome, The Moss Faery, The Owl on Turtle Island, and The Balsam Who Loved the Birch.

Many of these breaker boys worked 10 hours a day, six days a week all for as little as 45 cents a day. Child labor was common in the United States in the 19th century. It took the compelling, heart breaking photographs of Lewis Hine and others to bring the harsh working conditions to light. Hine and his fellow Progressives wanted to end child labor. He knew photography would reveal the truth and teach and change the world. With his camera Hine showed people what life was like for immigrants, the poor, and the children working in mines, factories, and mills. In the words of an historian, the more than 7,000 photos Hine took of American children at work aroused public sentiment against child labor in a way that no printed page or public lecture could."

9780816523603,"Around the turn of the twentieth century,  most photographs of Indians pandered to shameless, insensitive stereotypes. In contrast, photographic portraits made by Frank A. Rinehart conveyed the dignity and pride of Native peoples. More than 545 Native Americans representing tribes from all over the country attended the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition in Omaha in 1898 to be part of an event known as the Indian Congress. Rinehart, the exposition's official photographer, and his assistant Adolph Muhr made more than 500 glass-plate negatives depicting Native Americans in their traditional dress, now housed at Haskell Indian Nations University and regarded as one of the best photographic documentations of Indian leaders from this era.  This book provides an unusual perspective on the Rinehart collection. It features one hundred outstanding images printed from the original negatives made by Rinehart and Muhr at the Congress and over the course of the next two years. It also includes 14 essays by modern Native American writers, artists, and educators--some of them descendants of the individuals photographed--reflecting on the place of these images in their heritage. Beyond the Reach of Time and Change is not another coffee-table book of historical Indian photographs but rather a conversation between Indian people of a century ago and today. Just as the Rinehart collection offers today's Native Americans a unique connection to the past, this book offers all readers a positive understanding of continuity and endurance within the American Indian community."

Hendricks (1945-2017) revolutionized postmodern Black portraiture. This volume, the fourth in a five-part series dedicated to Hendricks' career, focuses on the artist's photographic oeuvre. Hendricks credited photography as a key facet of his practice, both as a tool for documenting his own work and as a source of inspiration for his paintings. Influenced by his experiences under Walker Evans' tutelage at Yale, Hendricks frequently took to the streets to capture the world as he saw it, with his subjects in their element as they lingered in front of stores or performed in jazz clubs. As in his paintings, Hendricks' attention to graphic composition and ability to capture his subjects' dynamism are stunning. For the first time, Hendricks' considerable body of photographic work is collected in a single volume, revealing an essential though underdiscussed dimension of his art."

9781681985534,"In The Posing Playbook for Photographing Kids, longtime child and family photographer Tamara Lackey teaches you her strategies and techniques for successfully posing and photographing children.Anyone who has photographed children knows: kids don't really do posing. But, as the photographer, it's your job and your responsibility to deliver lasting, impactful images in which kids look great. More importantly, the goal is to create photographs of kids that are authentic, engage their spirit, and convey their unique personalities.So how do you get beyond the ""cheese"" smile? How do you harness the wild energy of a kid who won't stop moving? How do you create energy and dynamism with a kid who just seems...bored and not into it? How do you do all that and achieve a compelling composition with flattering light and the proper exposure?Tamara Lackey has been photographing children and families for years, and in The Posing Playbook for Photographing Kids, she teaches you her strategies and techniques for successfully posing and photographing children. The book begins with a discussion of ""organic posing,"" an approach to directing the subject that focuses on making small adjustments that build up to a successful shot. Tamara moves on to the psychology of photographing children, covering how to read your subjects, work with different personality types, and elicit genuine engagement. She also discusses gear, accessories, composition, lighting, and camera settings.Then, in five chapters that are the real core of the book, Tamara tackles typical shooting scenarios and works through each kind of shoot, explaining what worked, what didn't, and how each shoot progresses from start to finish. Covering the real-world challenges you'll face when photographing children, Tamara discusses photographing children in the studio, in urban settings, on commercial and fashion shoots, in outdoor natural settings, and in groups. At the end of each of these chapters, she provides a handy reference guide of poses to fuel and inspire your shoots.TABLE OF CONTENTSIntroductionChapter 1: Organic PosingChapter 2: The Psychology Behind Photographing ChildrenChapter 3: Gear and AccessoriesChapter 4: Framing, Lighting, and SettingsChapter 5: What to Keep in Mind When Finalizing a ShotChapter 6: In StudioChapter 7: Urban SettingsChapter 8: Commercial and Fashion ShootsChapter 9: Outdoor Natural SettingsChapter 10: Posing Children Together"

9789863442899,"面對這張相片，我們要不是不予理會，就是得靠我們自己去把它的意義填滿。這張影像就和所有無法用言語表達的影像一樣，召喚觀看者做出決定。──約翰．伯格

攝影並非約翰．伯格的專業。直到一九八二年出版《另一種影像敘事》之前，他從未針對「攝影」寫過專書。他並非帶著策展人或攝影史家的權威談論攝影，而是以藝術評論者、作家的身分趨近。
伯格的創作生涯以視覺藝術為根基。一九五○年代初，他開始撰寫藝術相關文章；一九六○年代中葉，他的視野跨越藝術和小說的領域，成為不受範疇與類型囿限的作家。他討論素描的文章帶有身為素描家的權威感；他的攝影書寫則往往集中在受攝者的體驗及相片為他們描畫出來的人生——在伯格的著作裡，相片從來不是文本的插圖，文本也非影像的延伸圖說。
本書《攝影的異義》為《持續進行的瞬間》作者傑夫．代爾（Geoff Dyer）從約翰．伯格近半世紀寫作歷程裡，精煉出二十四篇影像散文，按年代順序選編而成。在這些文章裡，伯格是個別照片的批評者和閱讀者，以其獨樹一格的關注強度與時常懷抱的溫柔，悉心檢視照片裡的故事，向每一張照片提問。

[作者序]

純熟的攝影技術是好的, 但很難讓您在拍攝時放手嘗試。真正的攝影自由是願意透過「純真之眼」來觀看這個世界。在這當中『願意』以及『純真』是最重要的兩件事。我們生來就擁有純真之眼, 但不久後
就在父母與老師的善意教育下學習用大眾的眼光看待世界：好與壞、美與醜、令人不舒服與令人驚嘆的事情。

本書的衷旨很簡單, 無論這張照片的內容有多平凡或「難看」, 只要畫面上安排得當, 就會是一張有影響力的照片。無論您拍攝的主題是垃圾、優勝美地的半圓頂花崗岩山、一位時尚模特兒、或一個受到嚴重打擊的家庭, 只要您理解成功的畫面安排背後的「規則」與差別時, 就能拍出令人驚嘆的好照片。有時畫面的成功也不過是把構圖填滿而已, 就像我看學生作品時會跟他們說：「您與好照片的距離只差兩步了！」換句話說, 離拍攝主體再靠近兩步並將拍攝畫面填滿, 還有, 別忘了便宜又忠實的變焦鏡頭就是您的雙腳！其他時候您可以嘗試攝影三分法則, 或是拍照時將慣用的橫式構圖轉為直式構圖, 也可試著將鏡頭傾斜 45 度角來強調被攝主體。有時候畫面的問題來自於擾人的對比度、光圈選擇錯誤、平凡的視角、或者畫面本身太「平淡」。

除此之外, 這本書提供多種不同的視覺練習, 甚至連沒有視覺慧根的人在拍攝時都能學會先「看懂」, 並成功將畫面安排的有吸引力, 而我將這練習取名為「鬧鐘」。這鬧鐘能喚醒我們每個人靈魂深處的創意觀點, 即使是那些宣稱自己沒有藝術天分的人。

有部分攝影師 (以及大部分的攝影社團) 主張唯有靠拍攝時的堅持與運氣才拍得出有影響力的照片。若他們所說屬實, 那厚厚一本的攝影史就得被刪減為薄薄一冊了。

以羅伯特•杜瓦諾 (Robert Doisneau) 的世界名作《市政大廳前的吻》來說, 這張情侶在街頭親吻的照片幾十年來矇過世界上大部分的人, 讓大家以為那是碰巧捕捉到的, 直到 90 年代後期才發現那對情侶是杜瓦諾安排的模特兒, 並在杜瓦諾的指揮下往返, 直到拍到想要的照片為止。杜瓦諾當時無法說出事實的悲劇, 來自於當時只有自然、完全沒有被修改或捏造的照片才能稱之為「藝術」。

依我所見, 一張成功的照片在於它能讓觀者有情感投射, 讓我們看著照片後能感覺到開心、不安、興高采烈、作噁, 以及悲傷。總歸一句, 勇敢的用您一身的本領去創作吧, 別忘了還要勇於創新！

How were they portrayed through photography? How active were the Tlingit in shaping the images taken of them and in controlling their representation? Did photography remain an alien technology and activity or did the Tlingit incorporate it into their own culture?Based on research in thirteen North American archives (including the Penn Museum's Shotridge Collection), a close examination of hundreds of photographs, and extensive oral-history interviews in Sitka and other sites with both Tlingit and non-Native residents, Sharon Bohn Gmelch presents valuable insights on the motivations and reactions of Native subjects to being photographed. She shows the ways the Tlingit incorporated photography and came to use it for their own purposes, expressing a new sense of empowerment as they reclaimed images from public archives for their own purposes. This is the first book to explore the photographic imagery of the Tlingit during a critical period of change, from the 1860s through the 1920s. It also provides the first full treatment of the Tlingit photography of Elbridge W. Merrill, a neglected figure in the history of ethnographic photography."

The book showcases the skill and imagination of such notable Geographic photographers as David Doubilet, William Albert Allard, Sam Abell, Jim Stanfield, Jodi Cobb, Jim Brandenburg, David Alan Harvey, and many more. They share their techniques, as well as personal and colorful anecdotes about individual images and their adventures in the field-sometimes humorous, sometimes terrifying, always vividly compelling. Author Leah Bendavid-Val writes about the photographers' achievements from technical, journalistic, and artistic perspectives. Five chapters cover core National Geographic themes-wildlife on land and water; cultures in the United States and around the world; and science, from astronomy to archaeology to the human senses. The photographs in each chapter capture rare moments in nature and the lives of animals, along with defining events in the lives of people everywhere.

9783791387970,"This highly original and personal exploration of Tadao Ando's work, one of Japan's leading architects, traverses both the physical and spiritual world. In 2012, Philippe Seclier visited Tadao Ando's iconic Church of the Light, and was immediately compelled to journey around the world to further study the architect's buildings. This unique presentation of Ando's work is the result of what turned into a nine-year project to photograph 130 buildings. Walking around each structure, trying to find the proper framing, helped Seclier understand Ando's genius for siting and composition. Loosely organised by chronology, each building is represented in numerous black and white images, arranged like a mosaic on the page. These fragmented views correspond to Ando's own philosophy of the logic of structure and geometry. This ""atlas"" embraces not only the geographic but also thematic range of Ando's oeuvre - from transit stations in Tokyo and Kobe to art museums in Fort Worth, Texas and Provence, France; from an artists' retreat on the Mexican coast to the now-demolished Piccadilly Gardens in Manchester, England; from a theater in Milan, Italy, to an upscale restaurant in New York City. Seclier's photographs of Ando's numerous religious structures brilliantly illustrate his use of light and shadow to evoke spiritual depth and timelessness while his short texts offer concise observations of each building. A helpful appendix pinpoints the geographic diversity and range of Ando's oeuvre. AUTHOR: Philippe Seclier is a photographer and film director. His publishing credits include Hotel Puerto and La longue route de sable, based on a text by Pier Paolo Pasolini. He has directed two documentary films, Instants d'annee and Un voyage americain, about Robert Frank's book, The Americans.

9780500545065,"Is it possible to describe a photograph without interpreting it? Can a viewer ever be as dispassionate as the mechanism of a camera? And how far can a photographer’s intentions determine responses to their image, decades after it was made? These are just a few questions that David Campany eloquently addresses in On Photographs. In the tradition of Susan Sontag and John Berger, Campany explores the tensions inherent to the photographic medium – between art and document, chance and intention, permanence and malleability of meaning – as well as the significance of authorship, performance, time and reproduction. On Photographs is destined to become an instant classic of photography writing. Rejecting the conventions of chronology and the heightened status afforded to ‘classics’ in traditional accounts of the history of the medium, Campany’s selection of photographs is an expertly curated and personal one – mixing fine art prints, film stills, documentary photographs, fashion editorials and advertisements. In this playful new take on the history of photography, anonymous photographers stand alongside photography pioneers, 20th-century talents and contemporary practitioners. Each photograph is accompanied by Campany’s highly readable commentary. Putting the sacred status of authorship to one side, he strives to guide the reader in their own interpretation and understanding of the image itself. In a visual culture in which we have become accustomed to not looking, Campany helps us see, in what is both an accessible introduction for newcomers and a must-have for photography aficionados. Table of Contents Introduction • The Photographs • List of Works • Further Reading"

Very funny' Telegraph THE SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER In 1997, Charlie Lewis is the kind of boy you don't remember in the school photograph. His exams have not gone well. At home he is looking after his father, when surely it should be the other way round, and if he thinks about the future at all, it is with a kind of dread. Then Fran Fisher bursts into his life and despite himself, Charlie begins to hope. But if Charlie wants to be with Fran, he must take on a challenge that could lose him the respect of his friends and require him to become a different person. He must join the Company. And if the Company sounds like a cult, the truth is even more appalling. The price of hope, it seems, is Shakespeare. Poignant, funny, enchanting, devastating, Sweet Sorrow is a tragicomedy about the rocky path to adulthood and the confusion of family life, a celebration of the reviving power of friendship and that brief, searing explosion of first love that can only be looked at directly after it has burned out. 'The wit and real humour of his other books are here in this lovely rendition of what love is. A great read especially in England over the summer' ***** Reader Review 'What a lovely, beautiful book, full of wistful nostalgia' ***** Reader Review 'I loved this book. I've bought more copies to give to friends and family and will be recommending it to everyone I know who has ever fallen in love' ***** Reader Review 'This is a very special novel, both sad and funny at the same time, with such beautiful writing' ***** Reader Review 'A modern classic' ***** Reader Review"
9781732693609,"“Architects are trained to see a space before it’s realised, so I think photography helps me with that. But I’d also say it’s the other way around. My training helps me with the way I photograph. I look at space with a more symmetrical eye, and you see a lot of symmetry in my photos.” ~ Vivien Liu Vivien Liu studied architecture at the University of Waterloo and then attended Harvard University's Graduate School of Design, where she was awarded the prestigious Clifford Wong Prize in Housing Design. As an architect, she has worked for nearly a decade in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, China and Hong Kong, where she now resides and first took up photography. As a photographer, she quickly developed a strong sensibility portraying space as seen through the first person, which now defines her style. What began as a weekend pastime has transformed Vivien into one of the most prolific urban photographers in Hong Kong, attracting over 240,000 followers on Instagram. Her first book, Being There explores the dialogue and tension between people and spaces through portraiture, landscapes, and street photography, from the urban density of Hong Kong and Tokyo to epic natural landscapes like Zhangjajie, China. With an architect’s artful eye, Ms. Liu captures this juxtaposition in the most beautiful way, sharply highlighting her eye for patterns and symmetry across settings."

This book fulfills that dream and showcases the Blaschkas’ unparalleled dedication to their craft.Originally from Bohemia but based in Dresden, the Blaschkas worked from the mid-1800s until the 1930s. From clear, colored and painted glass they handmade their intricate models of invertebrate animals (including jellyfish, sea anemones, starfish and sea cucumbers) as well as plants―only on commission and for the purposes of study―mainly in Europe and North America. The objects were not sold to the general public and are today held in museum collections including those of Harvard University, the Corning Museum of Glass/Cornell University and the Natural History Museums in London and Dublin.It was a difficult process for Mocafico to gain authorization to photograph the Blaschkas’ creations, as most museums do not display these extremely fragile models.

After a decade of successfully making photographs with painterly soft-focus techniques, he became the driving figure behind a group of West Coast artists dubbed Group f/64, which pioneered the sharp, precise school of “Straight Photography.” With that stylistic leap, Weston’s career moved into high gear, creating photographs of extraordinary sensual realism, perfectly poised between compositional stillness and searing intensity.With nudes, nature studies, and myriad perspectives on the dramatic Californian landscape, Weston’s works aimed to locate the “very substance and quintessence of the thing itself.” In this concise monograph, we gather some of the finest Weston works to explore how he pursued and achieved this aim whether with a landscape, shell, or naked body."
