Do you need to start learning Python for Data Visualization from Scratch? This book is for you. This book works as a guide to present fundamental Python Libraries and a basis related to Data Visualization using Python.  Data science and data visualization are two different but interrelated concepts. Data science refers to the science of extracting and exploring data in order to find patterns that can be used for decision making at different levels. Data visualization can be considered as a subdomain of data science where you visualize data with the help of graphs and tables in order to find out which data is most significant and can help in the identification of important patterns.  This book is dedicated to data visualization and explains how to perform data visualization on a variety of datasets using various data visualization libraries written in the Python programming language. It is suggested that you use this book for data visualization purposes only and not for decision making. For decision making and pattern identification, read this book in conjunction with a dedicated book on machine learning and data science.  We will start by digging into Python programming as all the projects are developed using it, and it is currently the most used programming language in the world. We will also explore the most-famous libraries for Data Visualization such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc . What this book offers... You will learn all about python in three modules, one for Plotting with Matplotlib, one for Plotting with Seaborn, and a final one Pandas for Data Visualization. All three modules will contain hands-on projects using real-world datasets and a lot of exercises. Clear and Easy to Understand Solutions All solutions in this book are extensively tested by a group of beta readers. The solutions provided are simplified as much as possible so that they can serve as examples for you to refer to when you are learning a new skill. What this book aims to do... This book is written with one goal in mind - to help beginners overcome their initial obstacles to learning Data Visualization using Python.  A lot of times, newbies tend to feel intimidated by coding and data.

With dozens of code examples showing each step, you can gain new insights into your data by creating visualizations.Learn how to quickly turn data into insights with D3We have the data. But it needs to be understood by humans. The best way to convert this data into an understandable format is to mold it into a data visualization.And D3 is the best tool for job if you need to create custom data visualizations.With Fullstack D3 and Data Visualization you and your team will be able to share key insights, uncover problems before they start, and impress your boss by creating gorgeous visualizations.What's InsideChapter 0: Introduction When would you want to use D3.js?There is a spectrum of libraries to create charts on the web: on one end, you have easy-to-use, basic libraries that will create a standard chart type.Chapter 1: Making your first chart In this chapter we make a line chart. Line charts are a great starting place because of their popularity, but also because of their simplicity.Chapter 2: Making a scatterplot When looking at the relationship between two metrics, a scatterplot is a good choice. In this chapter we show how to create a scatterplot.Chapter 3: Making a bar chart In this chapter we cover how to create a histogram, which is a bar chart that shows the distribution of one metric, with the metric values on the x axis and the frequency of values on the y axis.Chapter 4: Animations and Transitions When we update our charts, we can animate elements from their old to their new positions. These animations can be visually exciting, but more importantly, they have functional benefits.Chapter 5: Interactions The biggest advantage of creating charts with JavaScript is the ability to respond to user input.Chapter 6: Making a map Maps are also uniquely good at answering geography-based questions. In this chapter, we'll build a map and learn how to plot values within a location.Chapter 7: Data Visualization Basics Now that we're comfortable with how to create a chart, we should zoom out a bit and talk about what chart to create. Chapter 8: Common Charts In this chapter, we talk about common chart types and when to use them. Chapter 9: Dashboard DesignA dashboard is any web interface that makes sense out of dynamic data, and in this chapter we learn how to make one.Chapter 10: Advanced Visualization: Marginal Histogram First, we'll focus on enhancing a chart we've already made: our scatter plot. This chart will have multiple goals, all exploring the daily temperature ranges in our weather dataset.Chapter 11: Advanced Visualization: Radial Weather Chart We talked about radar charts in Chapter 10. For this project, we'll build a more complex radar chart.Chapter 12: Advanced Visualization: Animated Sankey Diagram In this project, we'll be simulating real data and creating an animated diagram to engage our viewers. Chapter 13: D3 and React What's the best way to draw a chart within React? It turns out that there is a fair bit of overlap in functionality between a React and D3 - we'll discuss how we can create blazing fast charts using the two together.Chapter 14: D3 and Angular In this chapter we show how to create optimized SVG charts using D3 and Angular."

With more than 30 projects presented in this book, covering many use cases and scenarios, this book provides hands-on and practical experience of how to use the cellular NB-IoT for smart applications using Arduino(TM), Amazon Cloud, Google Maps, and charts.The book starts by explaining AT commands used to configure the NB-IoT modem; data serialization and deserialization; how to set up the cloud for connecting NB-IoT devices; setting up rules, policy, security certificates, and a NoSQL database on the cloud; how to store and read data in the cloud; how to use Google Maps to visualize NB-IoT device geo-location; and how to use charts to visualize sensor datasets.Projects for Arduino are presented in four parts. The first part explains how to connect the device to the mobile operator and cellular network; perform communication using different network protocols, such as TCP, HTTP, SSL, or MQTT; how to use GPS for geo-location applications; and how to upgrade NB-IoT modem firmware over the air. The second part explains the microcontroller unit and how to build and run projects, such as a 7-segment display or a real-time clock. The third part explains how NB-IoT can be used with sensor devices, such as ultrasonic and environmental sensors. Finally, the fourth part explains how NB-IoT can be used to control actuators, such as stepper motors and relays.This book is a unique resource for understanding practical uses of the NB-IoT technology and serves as a handbook for technical and non-technical readers who are looking for practicing and exercising the cellular NB-IoT technology. The book can be used by engineers, students, researchers, system integrators, mobile operators' technical staff, and electronics enthusiasts.To download the software which can be used with the book, go to: https: //github.com/5ghub/NB-IoTAbout the Author: Hossam Fattah is a technology expert in 4G/5G wireless systems and networking.
