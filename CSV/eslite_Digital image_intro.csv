9798746149558,"The fast development of multimedia computing has led to the demand of using digital images. The manipulation, storage and transmission of images in their raw form is very expensive, and significantly slows the transmission and make storage costly. Efficient image compression solutions are becoming critical with the recent growth of data intensive, multimedia based applications. Many techniques are now available and much effort is being expended in determining the optimum compression transforms. Compression is done using Cosine and Wavelet Transforms. Recently compression techniques using Wavelet Transform (WT) have received great attention, because of their promising compression ratio, ability to analyze the temporal and spectral properties of image signals and flexibility in representing non stationary signals like speech and images by taking into account human perception system. In this paper we describe the application of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for analysis, processing and compression of multimedia signals like speech and image. More specifically we explore the major issues concerning the wavelet based image compression which include choosing optimal wavelet, decomposition levels and thresholding criteria. The simulation results prove the effectiveness of DWT based techniques in attaining an efficient compression ratio of 2.67 for images, achieving higher signal to noise ratio (SNR), better peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), while the retained signal energy is 99.9885% and the resulting signals are generally much smoother. A comparison between Discrete Cosine Transforms (DCT) and discrete wavelet transform is done finally."

The book is suited for students at the college senior and first-year graduate level with prior background in mathematical analysis, vectors, matrices, probability, statistics, linear systems, and computer programming. As in all earlier editions, the focus of this edition of the book is on fundamentals.   The 4th Edition, which celebrates the book's 40th anniversary, is based on an extensive survey of faculty, students, and independent readers in 150 institutions from 30 countries. Their feedback led to expanded or new coverage of topics such as deep learning and deep neural networks, including convolutional neural nets, the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), maximally-stable extremal regions (MSERs), graph cuts, k-means clustering and superpixels, active contours (snakes and level sets), and exact histogram matching. Major improvements were made in reorganizing the material on image transforms into a more cohesive presentation, and in the discussion of spatial kernels and spatial filtering. Major revisions and additions were made to examples and homework exercises throughout the book. For the first time, we added MATLAB projects at the end of every chapter, and compiled support packages for you and your teacher containing, solutions, image databases, and sample code.

9780520286375,"How does a photograph become a news image? An ethnography of the labor behind international news images,  Image Brokers ruptures the self-evidence of the journalistic photograph by revealing the many factors determining how news audiences are shown people, events, and the world. News images, Zeynep Gürsel argues, function as formative fictions - fictional insofar as these images are constructed and culturally mediated, and formative because their public presence and circulation have real consequences in the world.  Set against the backdrop of the War on Terror and based on fieldwork conducted at photojournalism's centers of power, Image Brokers offers an intimate look at an industry in crisis. At the turn of the 21st century, image brokers--the people who manage the distribution and restriction of news images--found the core technologies of their craft, the status of images, and their own professional standing all changing rapidly with the digitalization of the infrastructures of representation. From corporate sales meetings to wire service desks, newsrooms to photography workshops and festivals, Image Brokers investigates how news images are produced and how worldviews are reproduced in the process."
