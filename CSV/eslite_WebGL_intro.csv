9781484263174,"Rakesh Baruah is a writer and creator with 15 years of experience in new media, film, and television in New York City. After completing an MFA in screenwriting and directing for film from Columbia University, Rakesh joined the writers' room of a hit, primetime, network drama as an assistant. The experience opened his eyes to the limits of television and the opportunities promised by 3D, immersive content. In 2016 he began a self-guided journey toward mixed reality design that has taken him through startups, bootcamps, the Microsoft offices, and many, many hours in front of a computer. He is the author of one previous book on virtual reality and the Unity Game Engine and has received an Nvidia-certified nanodegree in Computer Vision. He shares what he's learned with you in a style and format designed specifically for the person who, in high school, preferred English class to Trigonometry."
