9780367554194,"Text data is important for many domains, from healthcare to marketing to the digital humanities, but specialized approaches are necessary to create features for machine learning from language. Supervised Machine Learning for Text Analysis in R explains how to preprocess text data for modeling, train models, and evaluate model performance using tools from the tidyverse and tidymodels ecosystem. Models like these can be used to make predictions for new observations, to understand what natural language features or characteristics contribute to differences in the output, and more. If you are already familiar with the basics of predictive modeling, use the comprehensive, detailed examples in this book to extend your skills to the domain of natural language processing. This book provides practical guidance and directly applicable knowledge for data scientists and analysts who want to integrate unstructured text data into their modeling pipelines. Learn how to use text data for both regression and classification tasks, and how to apply more straightforward algorithms like regularized regression or support vector machines as well as deep learning approaches. Natural language must be dramatically transformed to be ready for computation, so we explore typical text preprocessing and feature engineering steps like tokenization and word embeddings from the ground up. These steps influence model results in ways we can measure, both in terms of model metrics and other tangible consequences such as how fair or appropriate model results are. "

9781801574563,"Do you want to understand machine learning? How it works and how is correlated to artificial intelligence and deep learning? If yes, then keep reading...Machine Learning is based on mathematics, specifically statistics. It is a probabilistic discipline that began in the 1950s. Despite initial enthusiasm, research and development in Machine Learning languished for over 30 years, suffering from twin ills of a lack of data to work with and computers that were too slow to effectively work with what data they had.It is no accident Machine Learning is coming into its own over the last 10 years. Until we began creating and storing massive amounts of data about our world, ML was mostly an idea in the minds of statisticians. And until computers reached a level of speed and power where these massive data sets could be ingested in a reasonable amount of time, the revolution couldn't happen. But as we digitize information about our world and ourselves, and computers continue to increase in speed and capacity exponentially, the ability for Machine Learning to learn from our data grows in depth and accuracy. Looking to the future, we can see only more and more data collection about our world, faster computer chips, and data transfer, and more avenues for ML to develop in, to grow and learn, and to serve humanity.When most people think of machine learning, they either have no idea what it is, or they automatically think about artificial intelligence in the form of a robotic species that rivals humans. While these fascinating subspecies may one day exist as the result of machine learning developments, right now the primary focus is on how machine learning programs can become excellent at very specific tasks. Most machine learning technology is developed in such a way that it is excellent at performing one or, at most, two tasks. By focusing entire technology on one single task, they can ensure that it runs that task perfectly, and that it does not get confused between the tasks that it is trying to accomplish. While simple computing software like the one that runs your computer can easily run multiple programs at once with little chance of crashing, the technology that is used to run machine learning technology is far more complex. As researchers study it, they strive to keep the algorithms mostly separate, or specifically focused on completing just one goal, on minimizing room for error.It is likely that as we become more familiar with machine learning technology and more educated in the algorithms, we will start to see more and more machines completing multiple tasks, rather than just one. At this point, that is the long-term goal for many scientists who want to see these machines becoming more efficient, and requiring less hardware. After all, the hardware used to run some of these machines is not always the greenest technology, so the fewer hardware casings that technology needs to be stored in, the less of a footprint the technology sector will have on the planet. This book aims to educate you on the truth about machine learning.This book gives a comprehensive guide on the following: What is Machine Learning?Machine Learning CategoriesSectors and Industries that use Machine LearningFundamental AlgorithmsRegression AnalysisBenefits of Machine LearningDeep LearningDeep Neural NetworkBig Data AnalyticsBig Data Analysis ToolsHow Companies Use Big DataData Mining and Applications...

If yes, this book is for you Machine learning (ML) is a data-driven approach. Hence it implies the availability of large datasets in order to make accurate decisions. In case only a limited dataset is available to solve a particular problem, it is best to use a deterministic approach. When a limited dataset is available it is hard to train a machine learning model and generalize its applicability to other similar problems. The developed model, in this case, is only applicable for the few data it was trained on.Because ML methods rely solely only on data and the human expertise or judgment is not taken in consideration, it is the data that dictate if the machine learning method will fail or succeed to perform the task it was designed for. The way a machine learning approach works is that a modeler develops a learning algorithm. Then the modeler feeds the learning algorithm with the data and information.Could Turning Important Decisions over to AI help Humanity? Some might say that's a terrible idea, but how much worse is it today where we've turned over our societies and civilizations to corrupt leadership, crony capitalism, or had to deal with rogue nation-states in other parts of the world with two-bit dictators, religious fanaticism, or the quest to destroy another group of peoples' civilization? Perhaps it's time we came up with a special think tank that could go through all the issues concerning our fears, and what we hope to expect from AI decision-making machines. That is to say how to get the best possible answer, all the time with the greatest probability.We all watched IBM's ""Watson"" supercomputer as it won against the top human Jeopardy players. It did pretty well, most all the time; didn't it? Yes, but it wasn't perfect, and perhaps that's the scary part. In fact, some of the mistakes that it did make were mistakes that even a child wouldn't have missed. Still, if there is a group of humans or a think tank, focus group, or Board of Directors constantly surveying the answers and asking additional questions, then perhaps you don't have to worry about an erroneous answer now and again. In fact, it might make you smile and feel good to be a human at that point.ML is useful anywhere you need to recognize patterns and predict behavior based on historical data. Recognizing patterns could mean anything from character recognition to predictive maintenance to recommending products to customers based on past purchases.This book gives a comprehensive guide on the following: Correlation Between ML and Artificial LearningThe Era of EvolutionML and AI in PracticeSelf-Driving CarsRobots and How they will Change Our LivesML, AI and IoTEthics of AIAI and PrivacyIs Artificial Intelligence Dangerous?Will Humans and Artificial Intelligence Live Together in the Future?...

9781801449816,"Do you Want to learn more about Python Machine Learning ?.... then read on.Machine learning stems from this question: Can a computer go beyond anything we can order to do and learn by itself to do a specific task? Can a laptop surprise us? Instead of having programmers carefully and manually writing a set of data processing rules, can a computer automatically learn these rules by merely looking at the data?This question paves the way for a new programming paradigm. In classical programming, on which symbolic artificial intelligence is based, human beings insert rules (the program) and the data to be processed according to these rules and obtain answers. Humans enter data and expected responses based on that data with machine learning, and the computer identifies the practices. These rules can then be applied to other data to produce different, original answers.A machine learning system is trained and not programmed. He is presented with numerous examples relevant to a given task. In these examples, he finds a statistical structure that ultimately allows him to produce the rules for the task's automation. For example, to automate tagging vacation photographs, many examples of images already tagged by humans could be presented to a machine learning system. The system would be tasked with learning the statistical rules based on associating individual images with specific tags.  Machine learning is closely related to statistics, but it differs from them in many important ways. Unlike statistics, machine learning tends to operate with large and complex datasets (such as a dataset of millions of images, each consisting of tens of thousands of pixels) for which classical statistical analysis such as Bayesian analysis would not be usable. . As a result, machine learning, and especially deep learning, exhibits somewhat limited mathematical theory - sometimes too much - and is more technical than mathematical. It is a practical discipline in which ideas often prove more empirically than theoretical.In this Book you will learning: What is Data Science and Deep Learning?Data Science and ApplicationsProbability - Fundamental - Statistics Understanding the Fundamentals of iMachine LearningTypes of MachineiLearningWhat is iPython?

9781484263723,"Machine learning has taken time to move into the space of academic economics. This is because empirical research in economics is concentrated on the identification of causal relationships in parsimonious statistical models; whereas machine learning is oriented towards prediction and is generally uninterested in either causality or parsimony. That leaves a gap for students, academics, and professionals who lack a standard reference on machine learning for economics and finance. This book focuses on economic and financial problems with an empirical dimension, where machine learning methods may offer something of value. This includes coverage of a variety of discriminative deep learning models (DNNs, CNNs, LSTMs, and DQNs), generative machine learning models (GANs and VAEs), and tree-based models. It also covers the intersection of empirical methods in economics and machine learning, including regression analysis, natural language processing, and dimensionality reduction. TensorFlow offers a toolset that can be used to define and solve any graph-based model, including those commonly used in economics. This book is structured to teach through a sequence of complete examples, each framed in terms of a specific economic problem of interest or topic. This simplifies otherwise complicated concepts, enabling the reader to solve workhorse theoretical models in economics and finance using TensorFlow.

9781801204392,"Do you Want to learn more about Python Machine Learning ?.... then read on.Machine learning stems from this question: Can a computer go beyond anything we can order to do and learn by itself to do a specific task? Can a laptop surprise us? Instead of having programmers carefully and manually writing a set of data processing rules, can a computer automatically learn these rules by merely looking at the data?This question paves the way for a new programming paradigm. In classical programming, on which symbolic artificial intelligence is based, human beings insert rules (the program) and the data to be processed according to these rules and obtain answers. Humans enter data and expected responses based on that data with machine learning, and the computer identifies the practices. These rules can then be applied to other data to produce different, original answers.A machine learning system is trained and not programmed. He is presented with numerous examples relevant to a given task. In these examples, he finds a statistical structure that ultimately allows him to produce the rules for the task's automation. For example, to automate tagging vacation photographs, many examples of images already tagged by humans could be presented to a machine learning system. The system would be tasked with learning the statistical rules based on associating individual images with specific tags.  Machine learning is closely related to statistics, but it differs from them in many important ways. Unlike statistics, machine learning tends to operate with large and complex datasets (such as a dataset of millions of images, each consisting of tens of thousands of pixels) for which classical statistical analysis such as Bayesian analysis would not be usable. . As a result, machine learning, and especially deep learning, exhibits somewhat limited mathematical theory - sometimes too much - and is more technical than mathematical. It is a practical discipline in which ideas often prove more empirically than theoretical.In this Book you will learning: What is Data Science and Deep Learning?Data Science and ApplicationsProbability - Fundamental - Statistics Understanding the Fundamentals of iMachine LearningTypes of MachineiLearningWhat is iPython? SettingiUp the Environment in PythonK - Nearest Neighbor AlgorithmsMeans ClusteringNeural Networks - Linear ClassifiersWhile most books focus on advanced predictive models, this book begins to explain the basic concepts and how to correctly implement Data Science and Machine Learning, with practical examples and simple coding scripts.

In fact, before we are born, we are already learning in a hybrid way, with labeled and unlabeled data, by its very nature, and all its mechanisms of evolution.You may think that you don't remember any important labeled data when you were a baby or child, but your mind and brain did a swell job to solve the puzzles that required some labeling to move on, as unsupervised learning systems follow.So we can think of a similar machine architecture where the basis for all inferences is supervised learning, but capable of labeling any data that is not done by humans or other machines. And even criticize existing labels.We are actually talking about machine learning - unsupervised - to generate labels for machine learning.And creativity, in my view, is one of the essential links to evolve in understanding and formalizing new machine learning models.Do you really want to easily learn and understand Machine Learning?Buy it NOW and let your customers get addicted to this amazing book "

9789353884413,"Was Rahman's AI and Machine Learning achieves that rare balance of making a difficult and complex topic accessible to non-specialists, without dumbing down. He starts with an enlightening and entertaining explanation of what artificial intelligence (AI) is and how it works. This includes often-overlooked fundamentals like what we actually mean by 'intelligence', artificial or otherwise. Rahman brings his explanations to life with lucid and, at times, surprising examples of AI already in use around us. He takes these back to first principles, deftly avoiding any need to understand the maths or computing involved. This allows him to demystify what the technology is really doing and show us that much of it is reassuringly mundane, despite the hype. This distinctive approach comes into its own when examining the challenges and risks of AI. It allows the author to remove the drama and fear of sensationalized headlines and doom-laden movie plots. In their place, he offers an insightful analysis of how the major issues surface, what options we have for addressing them and why some dilemmas may prove intractable. A must-read to understand the reality and implications of AI beyond the hype!"

9783110670646,"Quantum-enhanced machine learning refers to quantum algorithms that solve tasks in machine learning, thereby improving a classical machine learning method. Such algorithms typically require one to encode the given classical dataset into a quantum computer, so as to make it accessible for quantum information processing. After this, quantum information processing routines can be applied and the result of the quantum computation is read out by measuring the quantum system.  While many proposals of quantum machine learning algorithms are still purely theoretical and require a full-scale universal quantum computer to be tested, others have been implemented on small-scale or special purpose quantum devices.

9783030402440,"Designing molecules and materials with desired properties is an important prerequisite for advancing technology in our modern societies. This requires both the ability to calculate accurate microscopic properties, such as energies, forces and electrostatic multipoles of specific configurations, as well as efficient sampling of potential energy surfaces to obtain corresponding macroscopic properties. Tools that can provide this are accurate first-principles calculations rooted in quantum mechanics, and statistical mechanics, respectively. Unfortunately, they come at a high computational cost that prohibits calculations for large systems and long time-scales, thus presenting a severe bottleneck both for searching the vast chemical compound space and the stupendously many dynamical configurations that a molecule can assume.   To overcome this challenge, recently there have been increased efforts to accelerate quantum simulations with machine learning (ML). This emerging interdisciplinary community encompasses chemists, material scientists, physicists, mathematicians and computer scientists, joining forces to contribute to the exciting hot topic of progressing machine learning and AI for molecules and materials.   The book that has emerged from a series of workshops provides a snapshot of this rapidly developing field. It contains tutorial material explaining the relevant foundations needed in chemistry, physics as well as machine learning to give an easy starting point for interested readers.

9781108792899,"Successful investment strategies are specific implementations of general theories. An investment strategy that lacks a theoretical justification is likely to be false. Hence, an asset manager should concentrate her efforts on developing a theory rather than on backtesting potential trading rules. The purpose of this Element is to introduce machine learning (ML) tools that can help asset managers discover economic and financial theories. ML is not a black box, and it does not necessarily overfit. ML tools complement rather than replace the classical statistical methods. Some of ML's strengths include (1) a focus on out-of-sample predictability over variance adjudication; (2) the use of computational methods to avoid relying on (potentially unrealistic) assumptions; (3) the ability to ""learn"" complex specifications, including nonlinear, hierarchical, and noncontinuous interaction effects in a high-dimensional space; and (4) the ability to disentangle the variable search from the specification search, robust to multicollinearity and other substitution effects."

9781096963707,"The aim of supervised machine learning is to build a model that makes predictions based on evidence in the presence of uncertainty. A supervised learning algorithm takes a known set of input data and known responses to the data (output) and trains a model to generate reasonable predictions for the response to new data. Supervised learning uses classification and regression techniques to develop predictive models.-Classification techniques predict categorical responses, for example, whether an email is genuine or spam, or whether a tumor is cancerous or benign. Classification models classify input data into categories. Typical applications include medical imaging, image and speech recognition, and credit scoring.-Regression techniques predict continuous responses, for example, changes in temperature or fluctuations in power demand. Typical applications include electricity load forecasting and algorithmic trading. This book develops supervised learning regression techniques.Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in data. It is used to draw inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses. Clustering is the most common unsupervised learning technique. It is used for exploratory data analysis to find hidden patterns or groupings in data. Applications for clustering include gene sequence analysis, market research, and object recognition."

9781681733029,"Lifelong Machine Learning, Second Edition is an introduction to an advanced machine learning paradigm that continuously learns by accumulating past knowledge that it then uses in future learning and problem solving. In contrast, the current dominant machine learning paradigm learns in isolation: given a training dataset, it runs a machine learning algorithm on the dataset to produce a model that is then used in its intended application. It makes no attempt to retain the learned knowledge and use it in subsequent learning. Unlike this isolated system, humans learn effectively with only a few examples precisely because our learning is very knowledge-driven: the knowledge learned in the past helps us learn new things with little data or effort. Lifelong learning aims to emulate this capability, because without it, an AI system cannot be considered truly intelligent. Research in lifelong learning has developed significantly in the relatively short time since the first edition of this book was published. The purpose of this second edition is to expand the definition of lifelong learning, update the content of several chapters, and add a new chapter about continual learning in deep neural networks-which has been actively researched over the past two or three years. A few chapters have also been reorganized to make each of them more coherent for the reader. Moreover, the authors want to propose a unified framework for the research area. Currently, there are several research topics in machine learning that are closely related to lifelong learning-most notably, multi-task learning, transfer learning, and meta-learning-because they also employ the idea of knowledge sharing and transfer. This book brings all these topics under one roof and discusses their similarities and differences. Its goal is to introduce this emerging machine learning paradigm and present a comprehensive survey and review of the important research results and latest ideas in the area. This book is thus suitable for students, researchers, and practitioners who are interested in machine learning, data mining, natural language processing, or pattern recognition. Lecturers can readily use the book for courses in any of these related fields."

9781489507716,"This book serves two purposes. First, it teaches the importance of using sophisticated yet accessible statistical methods to evaluate a trading system before it is put to real-world use. In order to accommodate readers having limited mathematical background, these techniques are illustrated with step-by-step examples using actual market data, and all examples are explained in plain language. Second, this book shows how the free program TSSB (Trading System Synthesis & Boosting) can be used to develop and test trading systems. The machine learning and statistical algorithms available in TSSB go far beyond those available in other off-the-shelf development software. Intelligent use of these state-of-the-art techniques greatly improves the likelihood of obtaining a trading system whose impressive backtest results continue when the system is put to use in a trading account. Among other things, this book will teach the reader how to: Estimate future performance with rigorous algorithms Evaluate the influence of good luck in backtests Detect overfitting before deploying your system Estimate performance bias due to model fitting and selection of seemingly superior systems Use state-of-the-art ensembles of models to form consensus trade decisions Build optimal portfolios of trading systems and rigorously test their expected performance Search thousands of markets to find subsets that are especially predictable Create trading systems that specialize in specific market regimes such as trending/flat or high/low volatility More information on the TSSB program can be found at TSSBsoftware dot com."

9780262537766,"An up-to-date account of the interplay between optimization and machine learning, accessible to students and researchers in both communities.The interplay between optimization and machine learning is one of the most important developments in modern computational science. Optimization formulations and methods are proving to be vital in designing algorithms to extract essential knowledge from huge volumes of data. Machine learning, however, is not simply a consumer of optimization technology but a rapidly evolving field that is itself generating new optimization ideas. This book captures the state of the art of the interaction between optimization and machine learning in a way that is accessible to researchers in both fields.Optimization approaches have enjoyed prominence in machine learning because of their wide applicability and attractive theoretical properties. The increasing complexity, size, and variety of today's machine learning models call for the reassessment of existing assumptions. This book starts the process of reassessment. It describes the resurgence in novel contexts of established frameworks such as first-order methods, stochastic approximations, convex relaxations, interior-point methods, and proximal methods. It also devotes attention to newer themes such as regularized optimization, robust optimization, gradient and subgradient methods, splitting techniques, and second-order methods. Many of these techniques draw inspiration from other fields, including operations research, theoretical computer science, and subfields of optimization. The book will enrich the ongoing cross-fertilization between the machine learning community and these other fields, and within the broader optimization community."

9780367644321,"Machine learning algorithms hold extraordinary promise, but the reality is that their success depends entirely on the suitability of the data available. This book is about Ripple-Down Rules (RDR), an alternative manual technique for rapidly building AI systems. With a human in the loop, RDR is much better able to deal with the limitations of data.Ripple-Down Rules: The Alternative to Machine Learning starts by reviewing the problems with data quality and the problems with conventional approaches to incorporating expert human knowledge into AI systems. It suggests that problems with knowledge acquisition arise because of mistaken philosophical assumptions about knowledge. It argues people never really explain how they reach a conclusion, rather they justify their conclusion by differentiating between cases in a context. RDR is based on this more situated understanding of knowledge. The central features of a RDR approach are explained, and detailed worked examples are presented for different types of RDR, based on freely available software developed for this book. The examples ensure developers have a clear idea of the simple yet counter-intuitive RDR algorithms to easily build their own RDR systems. It has been proven in industrial applications that it takes only a minute or two per rule to build RDR systems with perhaps thousands of rules. The industrial uses of RDR have ranged from medical diagnosis through data cleansing to chatbots in cars. RDR can be used on its own or to improve the performance of machine learning or other methods. "

9783030403461,"This textbook introduces linear algebra and optimization in the context of machine learning. Examples and exercises are provided throughout the book. A solution manual for the exercises at the end of each chapter is available to teaching instructors. This textbook targets graduate level students and professors in computer science, mathematics and data science. Advanced undergraduate students can also use this textbook. The chapters for this textbook are organized as follows: 1. Linear algebra and its applications: The chapters focus on the basics of linear algebra together with their common applications to singular value decomposition, matrix factorization, similarity matrices (kernel methods), and graph analysis. Numerous machine learning applications have been used as examples, such as spectral clustering, kernel-based classification, and outlier detection. The tight integration of linear algebra methods with examples from machine learning differentiates this book from generic volumes on linear algebra. The focus is clearly on the most relevant aspects of linear algebra for machine learning and to teach readers how to apply these concepts.2. Optimization and its applications: Much of machine learning is posed as an optimization problem in which we try to maximize the accuracy of regression and classification models. The ""parent problem"" of optimization-centric machine learning is least-squares regression. Interestingly, this problem arises in both linear algebra and optimization, and is one of the key connecting problems of the two fields. Least-squares regression is also the starting point for support vector machines, logistic regression, and recommender systems. Furthermore, the methods for dimensionality reduction and matrix factorization also require the development of optimization methods. A general view of optimization in computational graphs is discussed together with its applications to back propagation in neural networks. A frequent challenge faced by beginners in machine learning is the extensive background required in linear algebra and optimization. One problem is that the existing linear algebra and optimization courses are not specific to machine learning; therefore, one would typically have to complete more course material than is necessary to pick up machine learning. Furthermore, certain types of ideas and tricks from optimization and linear algebra recur more frequently in machine learning than other application-centric settings. Therefore, there is significant value in developing a view of linear algebra and optimization that is better suited to the specific perspective of machine learning.  "

9780393635829,"Today's ""machine-learning"" systems, trained by data, are so effective that we've invited them to see and hear for us--and to make decisions on our behalf. But alarm bells are ringing. Recent years have seen an eruption of concern as the field of machine learning advances. When the systems we attempt to teach will not, in the end, do what we want or what we expect, ethical and potentially existential risks emerge. Researchers call this the alignment problem.Systems cull résumés until, years later, we discover that they have inherent gender biases. Algorithms decide bail and parole--and appear to assess Black and White defendants differently. We can no longer assume that our mortgage application, or even our medical tests, will be seen by human eyes. And as autonomous vehicles share our streets, we are increasingly putting our lives in their hands.The mathematical and computational models driving these changes range in complexity from something that can fit on a spreadsheet to a complex system that might credibly be called ""artificial intelligence."" They are steadily replacing both human judgment and explicitly programmed software.In best-selling author Brian Christian's riveting account, we meet the alignment problem's ""first-responders,"" and learn their ambitious plan to solve it before our hands are completely off the wheel. In a masterful blend of history and on-the ground reporting, Christian traces the explosive growth in the field of machine learning and surveys its current, sprawling frontier. Readers encounter a discipline finding its legs amid exhilarating and sometimes terrifying progress. Whether they--and we--succeed or fail in solving the alignment problem will be a defining human story. The Alignment Problem offers an unflinching reckoning with humanity's biases and blind spots, our own unstated assumptions and often contradictory goals. A dazzlingly interdisciplinary work, it takes a hard look not only at our technology but at our culture--and finds a story by turns harrowing and hopeful."

9798691930768,"BRAND NEW REVISED/UPDATED VERSION RELEASED ON 25 OCTOBER 2020 - Because of a corrupted file, some unwanted grammatical issues reported by some of the readers. These are now duly fixed, and a new manuscript was uploaded on 25 October 2020.The era of artificial intelligence has arrived. You, who only felt far from artificial intelligence, and the growing dream trees, are now inseparable from artificial intelligence. What does AI have to do with me? Isn't it a distant future that has nothing to do with me, not a scientist, a technician, or a computer programmer? Well, Artificial intelligence is not a story of someone who has nothing to do with it, but the fact is, it is now everyone's story. AI is already deeply infiltrating everyone's life. The question is no longer whether we use technology or not; it's about working together in a better way. Surrounding technologies like Siri, Alexa, or Cortana are seamlessly integrated into our interactions. We walk into the room, turn on the lights, play songs, change the room temperature, keep track of shopping lists, book a ride at the airport, or remind you to take the right medication on time. It is now necessary to look at artificial intelligence from a broader and larger perspective. You should not just hang on to complex deep learning algorithms and think only through science and technology but through the eyes of emotions and humanities. These days, elementary school students learn English and coding at school. Tomorrow's elementary school students will learn AI. Of course, not everyone needs to be an AI expert. But if you don't understand AI, you will be left out of the trend of changing times. AI comes before English and coding. This is because artificial intelligence is the language and tool of the future. This book opens your door to the most critical understanding needed of AI and other relevant disruptive technologies. Artificial intelligence will significantly change societal structures and the operations of companies. The next generation of employees need to be trained as a workforce before entering the job market, and the existing workforce is regularly recharged and skilled, there is plenty on this for reskilling too. This is the most definitive compendium of AI, The Internet of Things, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Science, Big Data, Cloud Computing, Neural networks, Robotics, the future of work and the future intelligent industries."

9783030403430,"This textbook introduces linear algebra and optimization in the context of machine learning. Examples and exercises are provided throughout the book. A solution manual for the exercises at the end of each chapter is available to teaching instructors. This textbook targets graduate level students and professors in computer science, mathematics and data science. Advanced undergraduate students can also use this textbook. The chapters for this textbook are organized as follows: 1. Linear algebra and its applications: The chapters focus on the basics of linear algebra together with their common applications to singular value decomposition, matrix factorization, similarity matrices (kernel methods), and graph analysis. Numerous machine learning applications have been used as examples, such as spectral clustering, kernel-based classification, and outlier detection. The tight integration of linear algebra methods with examples from machine learning differentiates this book from generic volumes on linear algebra. The focus is clearly on the most relevant aspects of linear algebra for machine learning and to teach readers how to apply these concepts.2. Optimization and its applications: Much of machine learning is posed as an optimization problem in which we try to maximize the accuracy of regression and classification models. The ""parent problem"" of optimization-centric machine learning is least-squares regression. Interestingly, this problem arises in both linear algebra and optimization, and is one of the key connecting problems of the two fields. Least-squares regression is also the starting point for support vector machines, logistic regression, and recommender systems. Furthermore, the methods for dimensionality reduction and matrix factorization also require the development of optimization methods. A general view of optimization in computational graphs is discussed together with its applications to back propagation in neural networks. A frequent challenge faced by beginners in machine learning is the extensive background required in linear algebra and optimization. One problem is that the existing linear algebra and optimization courses are not specific to machine learning; therefore, one would typically have to complete more course material than is necessary to pick up machine learning. Furthermore, certain types of ideas and tricks from optimization and linear algebra recur more frequently in machine learning than other application-centric settings. Therefore, there is significant value in developing a view of linear algebra and optimization that is better suited to the specific perspective of machine learning.  "

They must be able to surface individually relevant information if they want to capture the attention of their consumer and business buyers. And as people continue to receive personalized experiences from companies like Amazon, Netflix and Spotify, they have come to expect it from all the other companies they interact with, regardless of industry.One-to-one personalization is about tailoring an experience to a prospect or customer at the individual level. The experience could be on a website, mobile app, email, in person, or any other channel where someone interacts with your brand or company. In contrast to a one-to-all experience (one that is the same for everyone) or a one-to-many experience (one that is targeted to a segment or group of people), a one-to-one experience is truly unique for each person.While marketers have dreamed of delivering one-to-one experiences for over 25 years, it has not been possible without certain enabling technologies, particularly machine learning. Machine learning can comb through massive amounts of data, draw insights about what that data says about an individual, and determine the most relevant experience to deliver--in a far more scalable way than has ever been possible in the past.In this book, One-to-One Personalization in the Age of Machine Learning, now in its second edition, discover what one-to-one personalization is all about, how it has evolved and what the future entails. Learn how it's driven by machine learning, delivered across channels and powered by in-depth customer data brought together in a customer data platform (CDP).

Who is this book for?* Managers and business professionals* Marketers, product managers, and business strategists* Entrepreneurs, founders and startups team members* Consultants, advisors and educators* Almost anybody who has an interest in the future According to an article by Cade Metz in The New York Times, ""Researchers say computer systems are learning from lots and lots of digitized books and news articles that could bake old attitudes into new technology."" Oxford University professor Nick Bostrom argues that if machine brains surpassed human brains in general intelligence, then this new superintelligence could become extremely powerful - possibly beyond our control. MIT professor Max Tegmark describes and illuminates the recent, ground-breaking advances in Artificial Intelligence and how it might overtake human intelligence. As Oxford University economist Daniel Susskind points out, technological progress could bring about unprecedented prosperity, solving one of humanity's oldest problems: how to make sure that everyone has enough to live on. Distinguished AI researcher and professor of computer science at UC Berkeley, Russell Stuart suggests that we can rebuild AI on a new foundation, according to which machines are designed to be inherently uncertain about the human preferences they are required to satisfy. Industry experts claim that AI will have a negative impact on blue-collar jobs, but Mert predicts that Americans and Europeans will experience a strong impact on white-collar jobs as well. And Mert also provides research results and a clear description of which jobs will be affected and how soon, which jobs could be enhanced with AI. Analytics of Life also provides solutions and insight into some of the most profound changes to come in human history."

Sports Book breaks down A.I., machine learning, and deep learning into five unique business use cases-sound, time series, text, image, and video-and reveals how sports book marketing executives can utilize this powerful technology to help them more finely tune their marketing campaigns, better segment their customers, increase lead generation, and foster strong customer loyalty. Today, ""Personalization""-the process of utilizing mobile, social, geo-location data, web morphing, context and even affective computing to tailor messages and experiences to an individual interacting with them-is becoming the optimum word in a radically new customer intelligence environment. The A.I. Sports Book explains this complex technology in simple to understand terms and then shows how sports book marketers can utilize the psychology of personalization with A.I. to both create more effective marketing campaigns as well as increase customer loyalty. Pearson shows companies how to avoid Adobe's warning of not using industrial-age technology in the digital era. Pearson also reveals how to create a platform of technology that seamlessly integrates EDW and real-time streaming data with social media content. Analytical models and neural nets can then be built on both commercial and open source technology to better understand the customer, thereby strengthening the brand and, just as importantly, increasing ROI.The A.I. Sports Book reveals how these and other technologies can help shape the customer journey. The book details how the five types of analytics-descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive, and edge analytics-affect not only the customer journey, but also just about every operating function in a sports book. An IoT-connected sports book can make its operations smart. Connected devices can help with inventory optimization, labor management, marketing, and customer experience, as well as keep its data centers green and its energy use smart. Social media is no longer a vanity platform, but rather it is a place to both connect with current customers as well as court new ones. The A.I. Sports Book knows that social media can produce a healthy ROI, if done properly. Social media can also be utilized as a place to gauge a customer's psychological profile; it's amazing how much information there is in a Facebook like, a Twitter Tweet, or a YouTube comment. The A.I. Sports Book breaks down social media into its six different categories -- collaborative projects, blogs and micros blogs, content communities, social networks, virtual game worlds and virtual social worlds -- and shows sports books how to utilize each one to both market to individuals as well as to attain real-time competitive intel. This book will help sports betting executives break through the technological clutter so that they can deliver an unrivaled customer experience to each and every one of their patrons to ensure that they keep coming through those front doors, as well as onto their websites."

9781798191729,"What is Artificial Intelligence?Artificial intelligence is a system that tends to simulate intelligent behaviors into computer-controlled machines or digital computers. Artificial Intelligence normally gives a machine the ability to carry out tasks usually associated with intelligent beings like us. Some of these tasks include translating languages, decision-making, visual perception, and speech recognition. In simple terms, artificial intelligence is the capability of any machine to mimic intelligent human behavior.Contrary to what many may think, Artificial intelligence is not a new field of study. In fact, it is older than most millennials reading this guide now. This may make you wonder when the concept of AI really started and from whence it came.As you will learn, machine learning is going to be a big deal in the world of technology. Those who would have started using it to unlock their data will greatly benefit from it even before people realize it exists. As a smart person, you should use this book to familiarize yourself with how machine learning works and then learn how to use it to your advantage.These days, AI is associated with the high-tech companies that dominate the field. Artificial intelligence first started as an academic discipline, but it has since sunken its tendrils into the business sector. Many AI researchers have abandoned academia altogether and flocked to companies like Facebook, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google) Amazon, openAI, and so on. The said companies are all working on different machine learning algorithms and are without a doubt at the forefront of AI research. Those with advanced degrees in AI, computer science, and maths rather join the engineering teams of these companies than stay in the academia. And since they are at the bleeding edge, it is worth listening to what their leaders have to say. Some have been quiet on the concerns about AI, and others like Amazon's Bezos have said that they aren't worried about potential AI threats.But, other visionaries like Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and physicist Stephen Hawking have all voiced their opinions on the potential dangers of Artificial Intelligence. In January 2015, Hawking, Musk, and several other AI experts signed an open letter on artificial intelligence research, calling for increased study on the potential effects on society. The twelve-page document is entitled ""Research Priorities for Robust and Beneficial Artificial Intelligence: An Open Letter"". It calls for further research on new AI legislation, privacy, ethics research, and several other concerns. As described in the letter, the potential threats of artificial intelligence can fall into multiple dimensions. The good news is that the early stages of AI development that we find ourselves in are malleable. The future is ours to create, provided that proper time and care go into the non-engineering side of AI research and policy.Book Outline: Chapter 1 - Artificial Beings, a Brief History of the Human PsycheChapter 2 - Top Six AI MythsChapter 3 - Why AI is the New Business DegreeChapter 4 - Understanding Machine LearningChapter 5 - Machine Learning StepsChapter 6 - RoboticsChapter 7 - Natural Language Processing "

Link to the color one (higher price): https: //www.amazon.com/dp/9874273666.Everything is related to everythingThe book's premise is ""everything is related to everything"". It is noticed in the relationship across different sections, for example choosing the right data type for any variable could be related to dealing with missing values, and vice-versa.In addition, some technical examples are related to ""real-life"" situations as well as philosophical concepts. The ultimate goal is to simplify the learning journey. How is it organized?It's a playbook with full of data preparation receipts, using the open source R language. There are two types of examples, some are oriented to teach general concepts around data analysis (like the information theory concept), while others are intended to show how to transform missing values, choosing the correct data type, and the implications in any case; among others, using easy copy-paste pieces of code.Please note that this is not a book to learn how to program R from scratch, nor how algorithms are implemented (math and stats area).Who is the target audience?It's aimed to people who are Programmers and data scientists who work -or want to- in machine learning projects. However, the ones who don't want -or don't know- how to code, can get some useful insights which can add value as data project analysts.All the R examples are well explained in code comments.No math or statistical background to understand it.The book tries to be as tool-independent as possible. For example, the decision of what to do to deal with missing or extreme values is the whether we choose R, Python, Julia. What it changes is the how.Last wordsTo develop a critical thinking, without taking any statement as the ""true truth"", it's essential in this sea of books, courses, videos and any technical material to learn.

And as consumers experience personalized experiences from other companies like Amazon, Netflix and Spotify, they grow to expect it from all the other companies they interact with, regardless of industry. One-to-one personalization is about tailoring an experience to a visitor or customer at the individual level. The experience could be on a website, mobile app, email, in-person, or any other channel where a person interacts with your brand or company. In contrast to a one-to-all experience (one that is the same for everyone) or a one-to-many experience (one that is targeted to a segment or group of people), a one-to-one experience is truly unique for each person. While marketers have dreamed of delivering one-to-one experiences for over 25 years, it has not been possible without machine learning. Machine learning can combine many different sources of data, draw insights about what that data says about an individual, and determine the most relevant experience to deliver -- in a far more scalable way than has ever been possible in the past In One-to-One Personalization in the Age of Machine Learning, discover what one-to-one personalization is all about, how it has evolved and what the future entails.

It's the art of developing a narrative for your data, so that all the raw information that your institution warehouses and reports in bar charts and histograms is replaced with actionable intelligence. Here's what we know:   Data science can and should be an integral part of college and university operations. Institutional effectiveness should be working side-by-side with faculty and educators to collect, clean, and mine through data of current and past students' behaviors in order to better empower counseling and advisement services (whether virtual or otherwise). Data itself should be considered an asset to an institution, and the data mining process a necessary function of institutional operations.  So how do we do it? It starts with a solid perspective and great research tools. With Data Science in Higher Education you'll learn about and solve real-world institutional problems with open-source tools and machine learning research techniques.

揭開大數據、人工智慧、機器學習的祕密，
打造人類文明史上最強大的科技－－終極演算法！

有一個終極演算法，可以解開宇宙所有的祕密，
現在大家都在競爭，誰能最先解開它！

．機器學習是什麼？大演算又是什麼？
．大演算如何運作與發展，機器可以預測什麼？
．我們可以信任機器學過的東西嗎？
．商業、政治為什麼要擁抱機器學習？
．不只商業與政治，醫學與科學界也亟需機器學習，包含DNA解碼、癌症藥品開發等。
．你擔心人類會被大演算所取代嗎？可以避免嗎？該如何做？

華盛頓大學電腦工程系教授佩德羅．多明戈斯（Pedro Domingos）破解了一個在機器學習領域中長久以來的瓶頸，
成功把機器學習、哲學與人工智慧結合起來，這個突破性研究還登上了《新科學人》（New Scientist）雜誌的封面故事。

他指出，機器學習有五大思想學派，每個學派有主要的演算法，能幫我們解決特定的問題－－．符號理論學派：將學習視為是逆向演繹法，從哲學、心理學和邏輯思路方面取得概念
．類神經網路學派：導傳遞演算法可以模擬人腦思考行為，是受到神經科學和物理學的啟發
．演化論學派：遺傳程式規劃會在電腦上模擬演化，澈底運用遺傳基因和演化生物學理論
．貝氏定理學派：相信學習是機率推理的形式，是根據統計學的理論 
．類比推理學派：支持向量機從相似度判斷進行推論學習，並受到心理學和數學的影響

多明戈斯認為，如果有人可以成功整合這些演算法的優點，就能發展出「終極演算法」，便可以從大數據與人工智慧中，
獲得世界上過去、現在與未來的所有知識，將創造新紀元的文明。
站在大數據與文明終將合一的浪潮上，
終極演算法將帶領我們，望見未來。

不管你在哪個行業、什麼職業別，機器學習能幫你省下人工編寫程式的費用，避免資訊系統僵化，並預測未來你會面臨的科技發展，甚至讓你成為精準的市場分析家、解讀大數據的科學家。

◎如果你是科學家或工程師
過去的數學和現有資訊學習與數據分析，不會讓你有任何改變。
機器學習將讓你具備非線性分析，帶給你嶄新的科學世界觀，有所突破。

◎如果你是機器學習專家
雖然你應該很熟悉機器學習，但本書仍會提供給你許多新的想法、機器學習發展史上有價值的資訊、有用案例與類似的情境，甚至提供給你機器學習的嶄新觀點，啟迪你全新的思考方向。

◎如果你是任何學齡階段的學生
目前世界各地極度缺乏機器學習專家，這是現在也是未來最受關注的領域。
未來，不只局限現有的資訊工程、電機工程等相關科系，
無論是醫學、醫工、生物科技、行銷、電商、社會、心理、哲學、教育、財經等各科系，
機器學習終將與這些領域整合，現在了解大演算，你就不會被趨勢潮流所淘汰。"

前者認為人工智慧（AI）會毁滅人類，後者說不會！
其實你應聽Google的，
它提供平台讓中小企業也可以搭上人工智慧的特快車！

將衝擊世界的人工智慧類型基本上是指會自己學習的電腦，也就是所謂的機器學習（Machine Learning）及深度學習（Deep learning），而非過去大家習慣的電腦依程式行事。前者是指機器自己由大量資料中，得出某結論，如給電腦一堆貓的圖片，他會自己替貓做定義，進而由一張被切割的照片中，判斷那是不是貓。而深度學習則是電腦自行處理多層結構的訊息，而進行判讀。

人工智慧用5000部影片，就可以自己學會讀唇語！

曾有研究單位利用「深度學習」學習唇語的判讀，他們將英國BBC電視頻道的多個節目系列、合計約五千小時的影片做為學習的資料。學習後的電腦，在兩百支影片測驗組合中，光靠唇部動作便成功解讀出大約百分之五十的單字。而即使是在法庭上擁有十年以上經驗的唇語術專家，在相同的測驗中也只能判讀四分之一左右的單字。

電腦具備自主學習及判斷能力的事實將對人類社會產生重大衝擊，本書不只以一般人能理解的方式說明人工智慧在技術方面的進展，更以大量的實例，說明目前全球各種規模的企業如何利用會「學習」的電腦，來改變企業的運作。例如客戶服務的工作，原本極為依靠人力，但是，現在只要投入大量過去的QA，電腦會自己學會如何對應客戶；如語文的翻譯，電腦也可以自己由大量的翻譯資訊中學習，讓翻譯的品質提升。

善用人工智慧技術的企業，將在企業的經營上（至少成本的控制上），取得領先。問題是人工智慧的發展是否有很高的技術門檻？阻擋一般的中小企業於門外？其實不然。

中小企業也可以利用Google平台提供的應用程式介面，發展自己的深度學習運用

谷歌在其雲端服務「Google Cloud Platform（GCP）」中，將谷歌研究開發至今的深度學習成果透過兩種方式開放一般大眾使用（Google目前將人工智慧用在公司一千種服務以上）：一種是將機器學習訓練完畢的模型，以應用程式介面 (Application Programming Interface；API)方式提供服務。另一種是提供機器學習程式庫「開源機器學習系統（Tensor Flow）」。

應用程式介面（API）一般是指能將擁有特定機能的電腦程式由外部程式叫出使用的介面。透過應用程式介面與電腦程式連結，就可以直接利用其功能。

谷歌將許多不同種類具有「機器學習」或是「深度學習」能力的「模型」放在「谷歌雲端平台（GCP）」。中小企業可以利用應用程式介面，直接利用其功能。而這些「模型」已經經過基本的「訓練」，因此使用者只要提供少量的資料，就可以達成學習的目的。

因為有了應用程式介面（API）的提供，使得「機器學習」與「深度學習」為一般企業所用的門檻大幅降低了。只需以程式介面（API）程式將「模型」叫出，就能使用圖像辨識與語音辨識的最新成果，真的很方便。

不過另一方面，許多太專業的運用，如人體器官病徵的辨識或是機械故障的預兆判斷等，無法以應用程式介面（API）套用現有的「模型」。谷歌所準備的機器學習程式庫「開源機器學習系統 TensorFlow」將派上用場。使用者可以下載程式，自行發展所需要的功能。「使用TensorFlow最大的好處，是只要以Python語言寫出簡單的程式碼，就能運用深度學習」。

本書不只告訴你人工智慧是什麼？將改變什麼？更告訴你可以做什麼，讓公司保持在科技的浪潮尖端。
從定義到駕御：讓你徹底搞懂將對人類產生鉅大影響的科技

本書在觀察大量企業的運用後，在第五章《架構活用篇》提出導入的深度學習的具體架構，讓讀者不只能懂，也能縮短運用時摸索的時間。本書發現人工智慧（機器學習、深度學習）的風潮席捲全球，不過其在企業運用的目的不外以下幾種：1、刪減成本。2、提高附加價值創造出新的商機。3、提升創意性。而在觀察幾百家企業的操作後，發現以刪減成本的目的最容易產生效果。

用案例讓讀者完全理解

對沒有技術背景的民眾而言，最關心的是人工智慧（機器學習、深度學習）要如何運用，本書以實際的案例說明相關問題：

安藤HAZAMA――用以判斷隧道工程之岩盤硬度

為了建設隧道工程時能兼具安全與效率，安藤HAZAMA與日本系統軟體共同開發的「隧道開挖面AI自動評價系統」。將挖掘隧道時最尖端之開挖面照片輸入後，該系統就會自動評價其岩盤的硬度、脆性等工學特性。透過人工智慧帶來的岩盤工學特性評價自動化，即使沒有專家或資深技師在場，也能給予正確的判斷。

在學習之際，將五百張左右的相片進行分割，製作成五萬張的相片資料。結合相片岩石所代表的彈性波速度，一起讓機器學習的結果，在拍攝開挖面相片後，就能得到彈性波的速度值。新系統在從開挖面的相片辨識其相對應的彈性波速度上，正確率大約有百分之八十五。

AUCNET IBS――從車輛相片就能鎖定款式

深度學習特別適用於圖片的識別。從事支援中古車等業者間交易的AUCNET（位於東京都港區）系統開發子公司之AUCNET IBS就是圖片識別運用的例子。該公司運用深度學習技術，開發了能自動將車輛不同部位照片歸類上傳到網站的系統「konpeki（紺碧）」。二〇一六年十一月集團旗下的中古車經銷商FLEX（東京都港區）採用了這個系統，提升網站上資訊登錄作業的效率。

中古車經銷商經常需要為購入的中古車拍攝許多相片、進行上傳到自家網站或資訊網站的作業。車子的左斜前方、右斜前方、右側、左側、後方、還有車內的前座及後座、儀表板、導航等……。這些相片如果由店員手工整理的話，大概要花個五分鐘左右。Konpeki系統只要經銷商店員將拍攝的相片登錄，就立刻能自動依部位別分類，輕鬆地上傳至中古車資訊網站。

它將車輛外部區分為十八種、内部區分為十二種。它也會將包含車輛的相片、但並非銷售對象的圖像（如廣告）區分出來。甚至還能鎖定某品牌、車名、款式，顯示平均銷售價格帶。

「konpeki（紺碧）」系統的開發便是採用了谷歌的「谷歌雲端平台（GCP）」上為了開發深度學習模型的程式庫「開源機器學習系統（Tensor Flow）」、讓機器學習大量圖像資料而成。

以少量的訓練資料構築出車輛台數檢測的系統

Aerosense與大數據的BrainPad公司共同合作、運用了深度學習技術的作法。開發了從空拍圖像中測出停車車輛數的系統。先從實驗結果來看的話，使用了深度學習的空拍圖辨識汽車模型，在顯示了一百一十六輛汽車的測試圖資料中，測岀結果為一百二十二輛。

Aerosense的汽車辨識模型，其特點在於其從空拍圖辨識汽車用的深度學習模型，並非是從零開始打造的。研發人員說明：「若要製作專用的模型，將需要大量的訓練資料。即使有一萬張也不夠吧！這次是運用了現有的模型，大約只有一百三十張的少量訓練資料，就顯示出其高精確度，很有價值。」

在深度學習模型的開發上，活用了谷歌的深度學習程式庫「TensorFlow」。利用TensorFlow中名為「Inception-V3」之一般圖像辨識模型，從圖像資料中製作抽取了特徵值的向量。此時，使用約一百三十張的汽車空拍照作為訓練資料。抽取了特徵值的向量，再以一種名為SVM（支援向量機；Support Vector Machine）的機器學習進行學習，得出結果。
