9780367656638,"Reinforcement Learning for Cyber-Physical Systems: with Cybersecurity Case Studies was inspired by recent developments in the fields of reinforcement learning (RL) and cyber-physical systems (CPSs). Rooted in behavioral psychology, RL is one of the primary strands of machine learning. Different from other machine learning algorithms, such as supervised learning and unsupervised learning, the key feature of RL is its unique learning paradigm, i.e., trial-and-error. Combined with the deep neural networks, deep RL become so powerful that many complicated systems can be automatically managed by AI agents at a superhuman level. On the other hand, CPSs are envisioned to revolutionize our society in the near future. Such examples include the emerging smart buildings, intelligent transportation, and electric grids. However, the conventional hand-programming controller in CPSs could neither handle the increasing complexity of the system, nor automatically adapt itself to new situations that it has never encountered before. The problem of how to apply the existing deep RL algorithms, or develop new RL algorithms to enable the real-time adaptive CPSs, remains open. This book aims to establish a linkage between the two domains by systematically introducing RL foundations and algorithms, each supported by one or a few state-of-the-art CPS examples to help readers understand the intuition and usefulness of RL techniques. Features  Introduces reinforcement learning, including advanced topics in RL    Applies reinforcement learning to cyber-physical systems and cybersecurity    Contains state-of-the-art examples and exercises in each chapter   Provides two cybersecurity case studies   Reinforcement Learning for Cyber-Physical Systems with Cybersecurity Case Studies is an ideal text for graduate students or junior/senior undergraduates in the fields of science, engineering, computer science, or applied mathematics.

In Reinforcement Learning, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide a clear and simple account of the field's key ideas and algorithms. This second edition has been significantly expanded and updated, presenting new topics and updating coverage of other topics.Like the first edition, this second edition focuses on core online learning algorithms, with the more mathematical material set off in shaded boxes. Part I covers as much of reinforcement learning as possible without going beyond the tabular case for which exact solutions can be found. Many algorithms presented in this part are new to the second edition, including UCB, Expected Sarsa, and Double Learning. Part II extends these ideas to function approximation, with new sections on such topics as artificial neural networks and the Fourier basis, and offers expanded treatment of off-policy learning and policy-gradient methods. Part III has new chapters on reinforcement learning's relationships to psychology and neuroscience, as well as an updated case-studies chapter including AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, Atari game playing, and IBM Watson's wagering strategy. The final chapter discusses the future societal impacts of reinforcement learning."

9781681732138,"Reinforcement learning is a learning paradigm concerned with learning to control a system so as to maximize a numerical performance measure that expresses a long-term objective. What distinguishes reinforcement learning from supervised learning is that only partial feedback is given to the learner about the learner's predictions. Further, the predictions may have long term effects through influencing the future state of the controlled system. Thus, time plays a special role. The goal in reinforcement learning is to develop efficient learning algorithms, as well as to understand the algorithms' merits and limitations. Reinforcement learning is of great interest because of the large number of practical applications that it can be used to address, ranging from problems in artificial intelligence to operations research or control engineering. In this book, we focus on those algorithms of reinforcement learning that build on the powerful theory of dynamic programming. We give a fairly comprehensive catalog of learning problems, describe the core ideas, note a large number of state of the art algorithms, followed by the discussion of their theoretical properties and limitations.

9781516801107,"Chapter Five, Structure and Reinforcement, from the Stained Glass Association of America's Reference and Technical Manual. We all have a responsibility to our chosen professions and that is to be professional in the manner in which we conduct and practice that calling. There must be a constant effort to expand one's knowledge and skills in the performance of one's work. Towards this end one must always seek improvement and maintain a student curiosity, be open to new ideas, new and different or improved procedures. In this manner we grow and avoid the destructive stagnation of 'knowing it all.' It is important to the survival of our profession, that practitioners and anyone remotely involved in stained glass be aware of approved methods, as well as improvements on traditional procedures which have come to light. To this aim I have dedicated this chapter. However, there can be no chapter, no book, or series of books totally comprehensive in our specialized discipline, for the scope of procedures vary greatly from one studio or practitioner to another as do new procedures and techniques evolve constantly. Opinions may vary as to what is the most important element contributing to the success of a stained glass work. Though undeniably important, as are all the components in the successful production of stained glass, the essential ingredient to its survival is structure and the supplementary support, reinforcement. The emphasis placed on appropriate and adequate reinforcement should not be interpreted to imply that ours is a 'fragile art.' It is not. In the range of materials for creative expression, ours is one of the more durable. Unlike oil painting, watercolor, fresco, tapestry, and sculpture, ours is much less the victim of the ravages of time. Given the condition in which stained glass has usually existed-that of the extremes of nature's exposure on the exterior surface and that of an interior on the other surface combined within a thickness of approximately"

A solid understanding of our species' natural history helps us best meet their needs and bring out their fullest potential. With an understanding of learning theory and behavioral science we can really begin to influence our companion's choices in the kindest way possible. Positive Reinforcement techniques allow us to develop a strong bond based on mutual understanding, empathy, and compassion. With the help of ethology, biology, and neuroscience, we can better understand how our horses think and feel. Using all this objective, science-based information, as well as our desire to be kinder to horses, we can reshape the horse-human connection.   This book dives deep into the sciences behind how horses behave, learn, and feel with many custom designed charts and diagrams for visual learners to enjoy. There are over 70 instructional worksheets for you to apply this information to real life situations and individual equines.

9780202306094,"Therapeutic changes occur in many places, and among animals as well as humans. A theory that attempts to explain therapeutic changes should be based on principles that apply not only to those changes occurring during the hour, but also to those observed in the educational process, in interpersonal relations, and in the social milieu, as well as with animals. It would be desirable to discover principles broad enough to provide a deeper understanding of therapeutic change in this wide variety of situations.Experienced therapists appear to be similar in what they are doing, although they may disagree as to why they do it. In spite of the arguments about theoretical formulations, it can be observed that during an hour with a patient many psychotherapists may not follow their own theories too well. There probably is some relevance in a comparison of psychotherapy with a concept formation test: the subject gives the correct answers but is unable to state why he did so or what principles he followed in making his choices. The therapist, too, may help a patient but he is often uncertain as to ""why"" and ""how."" It is very likely that the effective principles in therapeutic work rest on processes that are more general than the specific principles advanced by different schools.This volume combines the elements of psychodynamic and cognitive behavioral therapy in a theoretical system that focuses on the importance of patient-therapist interaction, especially in terms of the exchange of subtle or covert communication cues. In this significantly updated and expanded edition of their classic text, Beier and Young analyze recent developments in new areas of practice facing today's therapist: managed care and the clinical impact of the control of healthcare delivery; and biological intervention and other issues related to psychotropic medication."
9780898628579,"This book is the first complete guide to implementing the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA), an empirically based, highly effective cognitive-behavioral program for treating alcohol problems. An ideal program for any practitioner trying to reconcile the needs of their clients with mandates of HMOs and insurance providers, this approach has been deemed one of the most cost-effective treatments available by recent research. CRA acknowledges the powerful role of environmental contingencies in encouraging or discouraging drinking, and attempts to rearrange these contingencies so that a non-drinking lifestyle is more rewarding than a drinking one. Unique in its breadth, the approach utilizes social, recreational, familial, and vocational strategies to aid clients in the recovery process. This authoritative manual is a hands-on guide to applying these therapeutic procedures. Opening with an account of the history of CRA and the empirical support for its efficacy, the book addresses the clinical concerns of those treating substance abusing clients. Specific instructions are provided for conducting detailed assessments of the client and interviewing concerned others. Sobriety sampling and disulfiram use within CRA are discussed in chapters of their own. The authors then present a step-by-step guide to each component of the treatment plan, many of which have been shown to be effective forms of treatment in themselves. Topics include  * behavioral skills training * social and recreational counseling * marital therapy * motivational enhancement * job counseling * relapse prevention Each chapter provides detailed instructions for conducting a procedure, describes what difficulties to expect, and presents strategies for overcoming them. Sample dialogues between clients and therapists, annotated by the authors, further illuminate the treatment process. The book concludes with a chapter that both addresses the common mistakes made when implementing CRA, and emphasizes the flexibility and benefits of this total treatment plan. An accessible and practical program, CRA can be implemented by all clinicians who treat alcohol abusing clients, regardless of orientation. Providing a cost-effective approach that is highly efficacious, Clinical Guide to Alcohol Treatment is an invaluable resource for the wide range of practitioners working in today's managed-care environment, including psychologists, psychiatrists, substance abuse counselors, and social workers.

9780262039512,"A project-based guide to the basics of deep learning. This concise, project-driven guide to deep learning takes readers through a series of program-writing tasks that introduce them to the use of deep learning in such areas of artificial intelligence as computer vision, natural-language processing, and reinforcement learning. The author, a longtime artificial intelligence researcher specializing in natural-language processing, covers feed-forward neural nets, convolutional neural nets, word embeddings, recurrent neural nets, sequence-to-sequence learning, deep reinforcement learning, unsupervised models, and other fundamental concepts and techniques. Students and practitioners learn the basics of deep learning by working through programs in Tensorflow, an open-source machine learning framework. “I find I learn computer science material best by sitting down and writing programs,” the author writes, and the book reflects this approach. Each chapter includes a programming project, exercises, and references for further reading. An early chapter is devoted to Tensorflow and its interface with Python, the widely used programming language. Familiarity with linear algebra, multivariate calculus, and probability and statistics is required, as is a rudimentary knowledge of programming in Python. The book can be used in both undergraduate and graduate courses; practitioners will find it an essential reference."
