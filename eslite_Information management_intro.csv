9781090149848,"Business Incubators/accelerators/coworking spaces can be key drivers of economic development. The typical business incubator is in a suburban setting in an area with a population of less than 500,000. Universities or university-affiliated non-profits operate most incubators. The standard incubator has 15-20 companies when full and a ""mixed profile"" of University and non-university clients from many industry areas, including pharmaceutical, Information technology, medical technology, ""biotech,"" and engineering - even retail. The model for most incubators has shifted in the past decade - economic development professionals are now relying on incubation, a ""grow-your-own"" entrepreneurial model rather than an attraction model, as the tax-incentive and relocation package concepts of the past have faded in their effectiveness to convince companies to move to new locations. Incubators are also beginning to ""specialize"" in various concentrations, such as ""Clean-tech"" or ""alternative energy,"" to emphasize and attract specific industry sectors and to focus on the core competencies of associated research Universities. Also, many incubators/accelerators/coworking spaces are capitalizing on the resources provided by industry associations, such as access to specialized equipment and partnerships with leading scientists. Accelerators are defined differently, and many are concentrated in major metropolitan areas with ready access to capital and intensive programs designed to help businesses succeed in rapid fashion. Coworking spaces are gaining in favor by providing a solid environment for collaboration and business growth, with exciting programs and educational activities to assist in business formation and strategic direction. The commonality here, for this book, is the facility itself - the physical and operational strategy of business incubation is a process - a great business incubator involves programming, mentoring, education and many other efforts to insure small business growth. Business incubation also usually involves an actual physical site, a building where clients have specialized types of spaces. Most clients are looking for a collaborative, reasonably-priced and well-designed space for their business. They want to look professional, have adequate space for their employees, and have space for growth. Planning, designing and operating such a business incubation facility takes lots of background knowledge and lots of effort; this book is an attempt to cover a significant amount of the planning and strategy involved with facilities management. While many incubation professionals have an entrepreneurial background, few have a background in designing and operating a physical facility. The complexities of such systems as heating, ventilation and air conditioning; plumbing and electrical; lighting; fire alarms and sprinklers; security; elevators and stairs; and many other systems are often ""uncharted territory"" for incubation professionals. While this book addresses these key systems, it also incorporates design tips and ideas for ""green building"" compliance, ADA compliance and flexible design. While standardizing sizes of spaces may be easier for construction, inserting features such as ""hotel doors,"" flex panels and varying the sizes of spaces can assist companies in growth and development, helping the incubator adapt to their needs. A review of adapting existing buildings or building a new building from the group up is conducted in this book.Also, after the physical construction takes place, an incubation professional must consider the operations aspect of managing an incubation building - this may include raising funds, maximizing operating revenues, and running programs. One book on Facilities Management cannot possibly cover every topic related to business incubation and its variants but we hope you find this book full of ideas, strategies, advice and tips that will prove useful to your program"

9781970001198,"Recent years have seen a dramatic growth of natural language text data, including web pages, news articles, scientific literature, emails, enterprise documents, and social media such as blog articles, forum posts, product reviews, and tweets. This has led to an increasing demand for powerful software tools to help people analyze and manage vast amounts of text data effectively and efficiently. Unlike data generated by a computer system or sensors, text data are usually generated directly by humans, and are accompanied by semantically rich content. As such, text data are especially valuable for discovering knowledge about human opinions and preferences, in addition to many other kinds of knowledge that we encode in text. In contrast to structured data, which conform to well-defined schemas (thus are relatively easy for computers to handle), text has less explicit structure, requiring computer processing toward understanding of the content encoded in text. The current technology of natural language processing has not yet reached a point to enable a computer to precisely understand natural language text, but a wide range of statistical and heuristic approaches to analysis and management of text data have been developed over the past few decades. They are usually very robust and can be applied to analyze and manage text data in any natural language, and about any topic.  This book provides a systematic introduction to all these approaches, with an emphasis on covering the most useful knowledge and skills required to build a variety of practically useful text information systems. The focus is on text mining applications that can help users analyze patterns in text data to extract and reveal useful knowledge. Information retrieval systems, including search engines and recommender systems, are also covered as supporting technology for text mining applications. The book covers the major concepts, techniques, and ideas in text data mining and information retrieval from a practical viewpoint, and includes many hands-on exercises designed with a companion software toolkit (i.e., MeTA) to help readers learn how to apply techniques of text mining and information retrieval to real-world text data and how to experiment with and improve some of the algorithms for interesting application tasks. The book can be used as a textbook for a computer science undergraduate course or a reference book for practitioners working on relevant problems in analyzing and managing text data."

9789869406970,數位科技將帶內容產業走向何方？盜版的未來是什麼？翟本喬邀你探究，為何「靠保護版權來收費」已經過時。為什麼科幻小說家尼爾‧蓋曼認為：「拷貝音樂不等於偷……」為什麼創作者阿曼達‧帕爾默樂見免費分享，邀大家擁抱拷貝？凱文・凱利在2016年出版的《必然》中直陳：「網路的技術需要自由複製的權力。」Boing Boing的站長柯利・多克托羅在2015年出版的本書中除了提到這點，也深入探討：●為何阻撓分享拷貝的各種技術都會徒勞無功，甚至損及創作者和投資者？●網際網路跟以往的科技革命不同在哪？舊的著作權規範為何不適用於它？網路，本是靠著拷貝來溝通的科技，彈指分享已是難以逆轉的溝通方式，著作權規範如果不因應科技與時俱進，將會變成「無差別殺人機器」。柯利・多克托羅熟諳網路科技運作原理，以及國際著作權法規範與發展，此外本身也是著作豐富、名利雙收的創作者，在本書中他要告訴你：●如果你是創作者，想找金主或拿作品賣個好價錢，要知道：給作品「上鎖」只撐得了三分鐘，不僅杜絕不了人們分享它，還會奪走你和投資者協商的大權，將它拱手讓給數位鎖公司。善用「網路」這個超級閱聽機讓人們談起你，才是聰明作法。●如果你是企業主，想開發客源或捧紅賺錢金雞母，要知道：認清新科技原理並善加利用，舊產業才可能在新世界找到出路。網路是超便宜、超划算的工具，不僅能大幅減少企業的硬體花費，也使得與人合作遠較以往方便，它不是你的敵人，而是你的利器。●還有，身為網路時代的閱聽人與公民，你不能不知道：限制資訊分享的技術，不只會使我們的電腦門戶洞開，隱私不保，為商業目的而阻撓網路分享，還會成為有心之人整肅異己的手段。不講「比例原則」的著作權規範，會讓你我「連躺著都中槍」！
9789862624333,"第一本探討數位時代身後事的實用指南   ◎數位遺產專家解析科技化社會的生離死別 ◎書末附如何管理數位遺物的十項建議  Hello World，自從進入網路時代，我們便不斷累積在網路上生活的痕跡；Goodbye World，當人生走到終點，我們又該如何面對與處理這些遺留的資產？   亞倫是一個飽受網路霸凌的孩子，在他自殺之後，Facebook 上留下的紀錄卻成為爸媽與孩子最後的接觸管道：「就算再給我們一百萬年，我們也不會登出他的臉書帳號。」   　　面對死亡的方式有很多種，有的私密、有的注重分享，有的接受靈魂離去、有的堅信靈魂尚存。在現代的社會中，網路讓我們可以用不同的方式去紀念（或者忘卻）已逝去的親人朋友。例如臉書「紀念帳號」的功能、有些人利用直播舉行網路葬禮。   亞當父親留下的網路商店怎麼關都關不掉「我甚至不能使用賣家協助專線。因為除非你是賣家本人，否則你不能打這支電話。」 　　在網路時代裡，有些東西或許會「活」得比你的肉體還要久——你的臉書帳號（到了2099年，可能會有大約50億個已經過世的人仍然保存著他們的臉書帳號！）、部落格、YouTube頻道，還有你的網路銀行帳號和數位購買紀錄。這些有可能牽涉到法律上的繼承問題。例如：在我們離開之後，我們的小孩可以合法的登入我們的臉書帳號嗎？比特幣帳戶是可以繼承的嗎？目前世界上的法律規章幾乎都是根據網際網路存在前的財產概念去訂定的，而網路世代的來臨也對法律造成很大的衝擊。   有限的生命，永生的網路 　　從個人經驗與各式案例出發，臨床心理諮商師艾蓮・卡斯凱特以溫柔而機智的口吻探討心理學、社會學、法律、精神、道德和商業利益交叉的複雜地帶，亦寫下現實與虛擬中面臨意外、困境和生死的動人故事。本書為這個緊密連結的網路世代提供了面對死亡的嶄新思考。"

9780226713892,"When Kate L. Turabian first put her famous guidelines to paper, she could hardly have imagined the world in which today's students would be conducting research. Yet while the ways in which we research and compose papers may have changed, the fundamentals remain the same: writers need to have a strong research question, construct an evidence-based argument, cite their sources, and structure their work in a logical way. A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations—also known as ""Turabian""—remains one of the most popular books for writers because of its timeless focus on achieving these goals. This new edition filters decades of expertise into modern standards. While previous editions incorporated digital forms of research and writing, this edition goes even further to build information literacy, recognizing that most students will be doing their work largely or entirely online and on screens. Chapters include updated advice on finding, evaluating, and citing a wide range of digital sources and also recognize the evolving use of software for citation management, graphics, and paper format and submission. The ninth edition is fully aligned with the recently released Chicago Manual of Style, 17th edition, as well as with the latest edition of The Craft of Research. Teachers and users of the previous editions will recognize the familiar three-part structure. Part 1 covers every step of the research and writing process, including drafting and revising. Part 2 offers a comprehensive guide to Chicago's two methods of source citation: notes-bibliography and author-date. Part 3 gets into matters of editorial style and the correct way to present quotations and visual material.  A Manual for Writers also covers an issue familiar to writers of all levels: how to conquer the fear of tackling a major writing project. Through eight decades and millions of copies, A Manual for Writers has helped generations shape their ideas into compelling research papers. This new edition will continue to be the gold standard for college and graduate students in virtually all academic disciplines."
9781509530182,"The rise of blogs and social media provide a public platform for people to share information online. This trend has facilitated an industry of self-appointed 'lifestyle gurus' who have become instrumental in the management of intimacy and social relations. Advice on health, wealth creation, relationships and well-being is rising to challenge the authority of experts and professionals. Pitched as 'authentic', 'accessible' and 'outside of the system', this information has produced an unprecedented sense of empowerment and sharing. However, new problems have arisen in its wake. In Lifestyle Gurus, Baker and Rojek explore how authority and influence are achieved online. They trace the rise of lifestyle influencers in the digital age, relating this development to the erosion of trust in the expert-professional power bloc. The moral contradictions of lifestyle websites are richly explored, demonstrating how these technologies encourage a preoccupation with the very commercial and corporate hierarchies they seek to challenge. A timely account of how lifestyle issues are being packaged and transacted in a wired-up world, this book is important reading for students and scholars of media, communication, sociology and related disciplines."
