9789864341795,約莫20年前，小編正在知識工程實驗室做研究時，人工智慧與機器學習是當時研究室的研究主軸，人工智慧更是資訊工程與科學博士班資格考的科目之一。然而在哪個年代，有許多教授並不看好這個領域能在短期內獲得突飛猛進的成果，原因在於，相關理論研究都已存在數十年了，即便是1997年廣為人知的深藍超級電腦，也只是靠著優異的硬體設備來打敗西洋棋王（採用的僅僅是暴力搜尋法，沒什麼好做學問的）。而圍棋規則所造成的複雜度（分支過多，導致無法單純依靠硬體設備來求勝）一直無法在人工智慧上取得突破。2016年情勢有所轉變，AlphaGo終於打敗了圍棋棋王，貢獻者黃士傑說明了所使用的是「深度學習」，這下子可不得了，「深度學習」霎那間熱門起來了，連帶再次炒熱了機器學習領域。在眾多求職網站上，到處都可以找到徵求具有深度學習專長的職缺，並且薪資頗高。對此，有許多離開校園五年以上的職場高手也想躍躍欲試，但又對於本身的能力有所懷疑，最常聽到他們這樣說：「人工智慧我學得還不錯，機器學習也修過一次課，但從沒學過深度學習耶！」如果您也是這樣的人，那麼這本書可以做為您快速入門「深度學習」的參考書。其實說到底，「深度學習」仍舊是由機器學習的一環衍生出來的，而機器學習又是人工智慧的一環；講得更明白一點，深度學習有時其實不過就是一種特殊的類神經網路罷了，聽到「類神經網路」，您應該覺得熟悉多了吧！或許您同時也會覺得，那好像也沒什麼了不起。的確如此，先來看看AlphaGo貢獻者黃士傑的博士論文吧，那是關於蒙地卡羅樹枝搜尋法在電腦圍棋程式的運用。您或許會問，蒙地卡羅方法不是幾十年前就發明了嗎？是的，AlphaGo當然沒有那麼簡單，但現今與數十年前最主要的變化是GPU誕生了，並且效能獲得大幅提升且日益普及（成本下降），而「深度學習」充分利用了這一點，將相關演算法的運算分配給為數眾多的GPU核心去處理，達到了效能上的要求。為了快速理解「深度學習」，小編替各位讀者挑選了本書，作為深度學習的入門書籍（這或許是第一本關於深度學習的繁體中文書籍），深度學習的原理與技術細節其實不只一種，各家大廠對此都投入頗深，當中又以Google堪稱現今人工智慧領域的霸主。因此小編選了這本書，因為AlphaGo正是由Google研發出來的，而為了讓更多人參與科技的發展，Google甚至提供了TensorFlow這個可有效運用GPU的深度學習框架，以開放原始碼的方式提供給所有IT技術人員，以期集合眾人之力來改變這個世界。話說，TensorFlow雖然因著深度學習而紅，但萬丈高樓平地起，蒙地卡羅方法的關鍵在於加入了機率這個概念，因此，本書將從使用TensorFlow求解數學問題開始介紹，進而朝向機器學習與類神經網路邁進，在此同時，您將回顧以往熟悉的線性迴歸、分類（Classifiers）與最近鄰居演算法、群集（clustering）與k-means演算法、單層感知器、邏輯斯迴歸、多層感知器等等知識，並使用TensorFlow來建立模型與求解問題。到了本書的後半段，將正式進入深度學習與GPU程式設計的議題，包含卷積神經網路CNN與遞迴神經網路RNN等兩種最知名的深度學習模型，並且在本書的末尾，也將介紹一個TensorFlow Serving，它是一種RPC，可以提供客戶端服務，伺服器可成功載入並執行經過訓練的TensorFlow模型，讓您沒有太多硬體上的顧慮。這使得實驗室裡的機器學習模型得以正式成為生產系統。不用再徬徨，現在就透過《深度學習快速入門—使用TensorFlow》這本書，展開您的深度學習的旅程吧！

9781484263723,"Machine learning has taken time to move into the space of academic economics. This is because empirical research in economics is concentrated on the identification of causal relationships in parsimonious statistical models; whereas machine learning is oriented towards prediction and is generally uninterested in either causality or parsimony. That leaves a gap for students, academics, and professionals who lack a standard reference on machine learning for economics and finance. This book focuses on economic and financial problems with an empirical dimension, where machine learning methods may offer something of value. This includes coverage of a variety of discriminative deep learning models (DNNs, CNNs, LSTMs, and DQNs), generative machine learning models (GANs and VAEs), and tree-based models. It also covers the intersection of empirical methods in economics and machine learning, including regression analysis, natural language processing, and dimensionality reduction. TensorFlow offers a toolset that can be used to define and solve any graph-based model, including those commonly used in economics. This book is structured to teach through a sequence of complete examples, each framed in terms of a specific economic problem of interest or topic. This simplifies otherwise complicated concepts, enabling the reader to solve workhorse theoretical models in economics and finance using TensorFlow.
