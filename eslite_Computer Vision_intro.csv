9780128149720,"Are you a computer scientist working on image analysis? Are you a biologist seeking tools to process the microscopy data from image-based experiments? Computer Vision for Microscopy Image Analysis provides a comprehensive and in-depth discussion of modern computer vision techniques, in particular deep learning, for microscopy image analysis that will advance your efforts. Progress in imaging techniques has enabled the acquisition of large volumes of microscopy data and made it possible to conduct large-scale, image-based experiments for biomedical discovery. The main challenge and bottleneck in such experiments is the conversion of big visual data into interpretable information. Visual analysis of large-scale microscopy data is a daunting task. Computer vision has the potential to automate this task. One key advantage is that computers perform analysis more reproducibly and less subjectively than human annotators. Moreover, high-throughput microscopy calls for effective and efficient techniques as there are not enough human resources to advance science by manual annotation.  This book articulates the strong need for biologists and computer vision experts to collaborate to overcome the limits of human visual perception, and devotes a chapter each to the major steps in analyzing microscopy images, such as detection and segmentation, classification, tracking, and event detection."

9780367572259,"Introduction to Visual Computing: Core Concepts in Computer Vision, Graphics, and Image Processing covers the fundamental concepts of visual computing. Whereas past books have treated these concepts within the context of specific fields such as computer graphics, computer vision or image processing, this book offers a unified view of these core concepts, thereby providing a unified treatment of computational and mathematical methods for creating, capturing, analyzing and manipulating visual data (e.g. 2D images, 3D models). Fundamentals covered in the book include convolution, Fourier transform, filters, geometric transformations, epipolar geometry, 3D reconstruction, color and the image synthesis pipeline.The book is organized in four parts. The first part provides an exposure to different kinds of visual data (e.g. 2D images, videos and 3D geometry) and the core mathematical techniques that are required for their processing (e.g. interpolation and linear regression.) The second part of the book on Image Based Visual Computing deals with several fundamental techniques to process 2D images (e.g. convolution, spectral analysis and feature detection) and corresponds to the low level retinal image processing that happens in the eye in the human visual system pathway.The next part of the book on Geometric Visual Computing deals with the fundamental techniques used to combine the geometric information from multiple eyes creating a 3D interpretation of the object and world around us (e.g. transformations, projective and epipolar geometry, and 3D reconstruction). This corresponds to the higher level processing that happens in the brain combining information from both the eyes thereby helping us to navigate through the 3D world around us.The last two parts of the book cover Radiometric Visual Computing and Visual Content Synthesis. These parts focus on the fundamental techniques for processing information arising from the interaction of light with objects around us, as well as the fundamentals of creating virtual computer generated worlds that mimic all the processing presented in the prior sections.The book is written for a 16 week long semester course and can be used for both undergraduate and graduate teaching, as well as a reference for professionals."

The text opens with an introduction to the mathematical background, together with a summary of classical variational algorithms for vision. This is followed by a focus on the foundations and applications of the new multi-scale representation based on non-linear eigenproblems. The book then concludes with a discussion of new numerical techniques for finding nonlinear eigenfunctions, and promising research directions beyond the convex case.Topics and features: introduces the classical Fourier transform and its associated operator and energy, and asks how these concepts can be generalized in the nonlinear case; reviews the basic mathematical notion, briefly outlining the use of variational and flow-based methods to solve image-processing and computer vision algorithms; describes the properties of the total variation (TV) functional, and how the concept of nonlinear eigenfunctions relate to convex functionals; provides a spectral framework for one-homogeneous functionals, and applies this framework for denoising, texture processing and image fusion; proposes novel ways to solve the nonlinear eigenvalue problem using special flows that converge to eigenfunctions; examines graph-based and nonlocal methods, for which a TV eigenvalue analysis gives rise to strong segmentation, clustering and classification algorithms; presents an approach to generalizing the nonlinear spectral concept beyond the convex case, based on pixel decay analysis; discusses relations to other branches of image processing, such as wavelets and dictionary based methods.This original work offers fascinating new insights into established signal processing techniques, integrating deep mathematical concepts from a range of different fields, which will be of great interest to all researchers involved with image processing and computer vision applications, as well as computations for more general scientific problems."

9780262533515,"In 1936, when he was just twenty-four years old, Alan Turing wrote a remarkable paper in which he outlined the theory of computation, laying out the ideas that underlie all modern computers. This groundbreaking and powerful theory now forms the basis of computer science. In Turing's Vision, Chris Bernhardt explains the theory, Turing's most important contribution, for the general reader. Bernhardt argues that the strength of Turing's theory is its simplicity, and that, explained in a straightforward manner, it is eminently understandable by the nonspecialist. As Marvin Minsky writes, ""The sheer simplicity of the theory's foundation and extraordinary short path from this foundation to its logical and surprising conclusions give the theory a mathematical beauty that alone guarantees it a permanent place in computer theory."" Bernhardt begins with the foundation and systematically builds to the surprising conclusions. He also views Turing's theory in the context of mathematical history, other views of computation (including those of Alonzo Church), Turing's later work, and the birth of the modern computer.In the paper, ""On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem,"" Turing thinks carefully about how humans perform computation, breaking it down into a sequence of steps, and then constructs theoretical machines capable of performing each step. Turing wanted to show that there were problems that were beyond any computer's ability to solve; in particular, he wanted to find a decision problem that he could prove was undecidable. To explain Turing's ideas, Bernhardt examines three well-known decision problems to explore the concept of undecidability; investigates theoretical computing machines, including Turing machines; explains universal machines; and proves that certain problems are undecidable, including Turing's problem concerning computable numbers."
