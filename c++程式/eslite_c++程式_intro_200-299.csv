9781098360030,"Can expressiveness in music be learned, or is it an innate gift, and you either have it or you don't? Musical expression can be learned! Expression: The Essence of Music is an insight into what distinguishes musical artistry above and beyond excellent craft. This is a guide to expressive performance intended for all musicians (vocal or instrumental), conductors, teachers, and students at any level that may benefit from suggestions as to how they, or their ensemble, or their students, can perform with more musicality and expressiveness. Robert Musser gives us a fresh look at how to break down expression into elements that can be explained and instructed, both on an individual and class level. The author presents an approach to phrasing and performing that, when learned and followed, will make any performance (solo or ensemble) more musical and expressive. He also looks at the artistic conventions and nuances (not tone quality and technique), which are essential to musical performance but often neglected or performed poorly. With clear explanations and ample musical examples, he shows how to incorporate these ideas and techniques into one's performance or teaching."

Es muy importante detenernos en esta última palabra porque muchas veces confundimos felicidad con perfección, ser feliz no significa tener todo lo que deseamos porque en esta vida por naturaleza estamos expuestos al dolor, ser feliz es sentirnos en paz y plenos con nosotros mismos y con los demás en medio de cualquier situación por más difícil que esta sea.Cuando hablamos del dolor tenemos que mencionar también el sufrimiento, recordemos que como seres humanos que somos estamos expuestos a cualquier situación que pueda causarnos dolor, sin embargo, el sufrimiento es opcional, entiendo que para nosotros el hecho de no sufrir es algo difícil de comprender porque hay situaciones que hay veces parecieran que nos desboronan, sin embargo en estas líneas encontrarás que si se puede, si podemos levantarnos y continuar en esta vida pese a cualquier obstáculo que se nos presente, todo está en aprender a reeducar nuestro cerebro, entendiendo desde un comienzo que estamos compuestos por cuerpo, mente y alma.Reentrenar nuestro cerebro es vivir de manera consciente en el presente, no detenernos en nuestro pasado para no recriminarnos nada ni sentirnos culpables, ni tampoco pensar en el futuro porque nos estaríamos adelantando a los hechos, cuando empezamos a vivir en el presente pero con consciencia escuchando nuestra voz interior y enfocando toda nuestra atención en lo realmente importante, encaminaremos toda nuestra energía en cumplir nuestros sueños, y cuando alineamos estas metas con el propósito de nuestra vida logramos permanecer en paz y en armonía, que no es más que sentirnos felices y plenos.Buy it NOW and let your customers get addicted to this amazing book!"

El destino.De la enfermedad o la inarmonía del cuerpo y sus desmanes, a las sanaciones o autocuraciones dirigidas por seres de luz; causales intangibles, conducentes al milagro."
9781039105799,"Each piece in this book takes you on a journey into the interior spaces of your spirit. The book is divided into two sections: guided meditations and midrashic monologues.The guided meditations invite you to imagine places and experiences that will lead you toward peace in your own life and heart. The contexts of a hermit's cell, a grandmother's lap, and a high mountaintop set the stage for exploring themes such as fear, gratitude, gifts, and peace. Each one leads you back to love.The second section intertwines words and imagination to explore stories, with the ideas and emotions from scripture and the Early Church. Imagine the lives of Zechariah, Mary, and Simeon, and enter into their thoughts and feelings as they relate to Jesus. What might it have been like to be the woman who touched the hem of Jesus' garment, or the woman at the well? The people and their stories come alive through narratives inspired by the Jewish tradition of Midrash.People and Places of Sacred Interior Spaces is a valuable guide to encountering a loving and welcoming God for individual and group use."

He's content to tend to the concerns of his aging parishioners at St. Patrick--including the Brennans, whom he suspects are being swindled--and be a loving, if remote, uncle to his sister Lizzie's two children. There's also the matter of coping with the growing insistence of the sinister, unseen presence that has inhabited his life for two decades now. Twenty-seven-year-old Emily Bell is desperate to fit into the rarefied world of her colleagues at the Manhattan auction house where she works. When a weekend jaunt to Newport, Rhode Island, ends in pain and humiliation, it's too much to bear. On a hot, sticky summer night, Father Ennis gets a phone call that upends more than the routine of his days. It brings Jim and Emily together, marking the start of a friendship between savior and saved that will change them both forever. It also marks the beginning of a battle against evils both ordinary and supernatural. Alive with memorable characters, Ryan's finely crafted novel explores the ability of love to forge bonds of friendship, to mend broken places, and to summon the courage to face even the most daunting darkness."

Mays, former president of Morehouse College who said, ""It must be borne in the mind that the tragedy in life doesn't lie in not reaching your goal. The tragedy lies in having no goal to reach. It isn't a calamity to die with dreams unfulfilled, but it is a calamity not to dream. It is not a disaster to be unable to capture your ideal, but it is a disaster to have no ideal to capture.

Your Customers Will Never Stop to Use the Awesome Cookbook!The anti-inflammatory diet is a practical, healthy way of eating that treats and prevents inflammation associated with many chronic conditions and illnesses. So what is inflammation and what makes it so toxic to your body. When you experience inflammation when you're hurt or sick, it often shows itself as redness, pain, and swelling. These manifestations of inflammation are the result of your body trying to heal itself. When your body does this for no good reason, however, it causes damage to your body. There are several reasons why you're body goes through inflammation. These causes include stress, genetics, and exposure to life's daily dose of toxins. An unhealthy diet filled with starch and fat that have been fried at high temperatures has also been found to cause inflammation. However, the good news is that your diet in itself can help reverse this deadly cycle of unnecessary inflammation. So which types of food should you buy and prepare? The main types of food which help to reduce inflammation are dark, leafy, and cruciferous vegetables such as spinach, kale, broccoli, and cauliflower. Berries have also been found to help prevent unnecessary inflammation. Beans and whole grains such as brown rice, black rice, and quinoa serve as excellent sources of carbohydrates. While fish, beans, and chicken comprise your main sources of protein. When inflammation becomes a regular occurrence itself as a faulty action (as a result of a health condition, but not to heal the body), it can be a serious hindrance in feeling and functioning well. Preventing inflammation can be done successfully through diet, and this includes significant relief from many conditions, including arthritis, psoriasis, colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and respiratory conditions (asthma, bronchitis). Due to the nutrient-richness of this diet, there are further benefits including significant weight loss and the successful treatment of diabetes (regulating insulin levels), heart disease, lupus, and heart disease. Metabolism and an overall sense of feeling well are further advantages of the anti-inflammatory diet.

Twelve-year-old Speck escapes from his abusive father and Montvale, the human colony planet he lives on in the M80 galaxy, by stowing away aboard the famed Circus Galaxica, a space-traveling circus of specially talented aliens, to try to find his mother who'd abandon him a year ago. What Speck finds instead are some dark truths about life and growing up - but he also finds solace, love and security with his new family of aliens, discovering the true meaning of tolerance while learning about their many diverse cultures.

9781955351041,"It is a rarity to find a book that includes the unaltered original texts of all three of America's most conservative documents. It is even more difficult to find one compiled by a political Conservative! Award-winning historian Lochlainn Seabrook has permanently solved this problem with his little volume America's Three Constitutions: Complete Texts of the Articles of Confederation, U.S. Constitution, and C.S. Constitution. In addition to these three important charters, Mr. Seabrook also provides numerous supplemental conservative documents that are seldom recognized or discussed today; critical early writings that helped forge the spectacular country that George Washington called a ""confederate republic"" The United States of America.The papers in this heavily illustrated work span 87 years, from 1774 to 1861, covering the period in which the following significant events took place: The secession of the 13 American colonies (in response to the tyranny of monarchical Great Britain), the American Revolutionary War, the founding of the United States of America, the writing of the Articles of Confederation, the Philadelphia Convention, the writing of the Constitution of the United States of America, the secession of 13 (eleven full, two partial) Southern states (in response to the tyranny of the Left-wing North), the formation of the Confederate States of America, the writing of the Constitution of the Confederate States of America, and the start of Lincoln's War on the U.S. Constitution.While leaving the original 18th- and 19th-Century texts intact and unedited, Mr. Seabrook provides historical bullet points for each document which supply background and context to the creation and development of both the United States of America and the Confederate States of America. The author-editor also includes an introduction, index, appendices, endnotes, and a bibliography.

Twelve-year-old Speck escapes from his abusive father and Montvale, the human colony planet he lives on in the M80 galaxy, by stowing away aboard the famed Circus Galaxica, a space-traveling circus of specially talented aliens, to try to find his mother who'd abandon him a year ago. What Speck finds instead are some dark truths about life and growing up - but he also finds solace, love and security with his new family of aliens, discovering the true meaning of tolerance while learning about their many diverse cultures. Uncle Zwizzler's Circus Galaxica: The Greatest Show in the Galaxy is a poignant, sometimes humorous, often times metaphorical, fast-paced coming-of-age story set among the stars of the M80 Galaxy."
9781955351058,"It is a rarity to find a book that includes the unaltered original texts of all three of America's most conservative documents. It is even more difficult to find one compiled by a political Conservative! Award-winning historian Lochlainn Seabrook has permanently solved this problem with his little volume America's Three Constitutions: Complete Texts of the Articles of Confederation, U.S. Constitution, and C.S. Constitution. In addition to these three important charters, Mr. Seabrook also provides numerous supplemental conservative documents that are seldom recognized or discussed today; critical early writings that helped forge the spectacular country that George Washington called a ""confederate republic"" The United States of America.The papers in this heavily illustrated work span 87 years, from 1774 to 1861, covering the period in which the following significant events took place: The secession of the 13 American colonies (in response to the tyranny of monarchical Great Britain), the American Revolutionary War, the founding of the United States of America, the writing of the Articles of Confederation, the Philadelphia Convention, the writing of the Constitution of the United States of America, the secession of 13 (eleven full, two partial) Southern states (in response to the tyranny of the Left-wing North), the formation of the Confederate States of America, the writing of the Constitution of the Confederate States of America, and the start of Lincoln's War on the U.S. Constitution.While leaving the original 18th- and 19th-Century texts intact and unedited, Mr. Seabrook provides historical bullet points for each document which supply background and context to the creation and development of both the United States of America and the Confederate States of America. The author-editor also includes an introduction, index, appendices, endnotes, and a bibliography.

With the logic of a lawyer and the scientific expertise of an immunologist, Hugh McTavish, J.D., Ph.D., walks us through the COVID-19 pandemic in both scientific and human terms, beyond the simple metrics of case and death counts to the far more devastating consequences of our social response to this disease. His careful review of the scientific evidence related to COVID-19 transmission and his analysis of the human and economic costs of our lockdown response to this scourge reveal both the distressing dysfunctionality of our governing elite as well as an unexpected path forward to making enlightened policy decisions that offer the hope of solutions to our greatest and most enduring national and global challenges."

An important analysis of the links between the Indian Diaspora and the state and how this Diaspora can influence economic and foreign policy making in their country of origin. M.C. Lall focuses on India, presenting an unusual case whereby the Indian government in post- independence years ostracized its Diaspora despite the need for outside help with India's economic development. This in-depth study of the failure of the Indian government to make good use of its Diaspora looks at the reasons why India did not cultivate a relationship after independence; why there was still no change even in light of its economic liberalization and what have been the consequences of this missing relationship."

According to the Britannica encyclopedia, The Ruins ""epitomized the rationalist historical and political thought of the 18th century"" and was among the most widely read ones in Europe until the 1850s, years when Volney was considered one of the most notorious philosophers in Europe. The Ruins inaugurated a new age of questioning, paving the path to academical research on the historicity of the real Christ, initially in Germany in the 19th century, and soon in whole Europe and in the United States. Today, scholars, experts in Greek, Hebrew, and Latin, and University Professors write books published by Universities explaining how Gospels were really written, how biblical verses were forged, what kind of influence the miracles and teachings in the biblical gospels had from ancient myths etc."

9780367232740,"Place is integral to tourism. In tourism, almost all issues can ultimately be traced back to human-place interactions and human-place relationships. Sense of place, also referred to as place attachment, topophilia, and community sentiment, has received significant attention in tourism studies because it both contributes to, and is affected by, tourism.  This book, written by notable authors in the field, examines sense of place and place attachment in terms of a typology of sense of place/place attachment that includes genealogical/historical, narrative/cultural, economic, ideological, cosmological, and dynamic elements. Dimensions of place attachment such as place identity, place dependence, and affective attachment are discussed as well as place marketing, place making, and destination management.  Complete with a range of illustrative international cases and examples ranging from Santa Claus to the importance of place in indigenous and traditional cultures, this book represents a substantial addition to knowledge on the inseparable relationship between tourism and place and will be of great interest to all upper-level students and researchers of Tourism.

The story of the Ashe County frescoes celebrates their setting in the Blue Ridge Mountains and testifies to Long's intensity, precision and stamina.

Drawn from extensive interviews with the artist, this book explores the frescoes' uniqueness. Interviews with people used as models, assistants, volunteers and observers focus on the frescoes' impact on the community, and the role of the Ashe County Frescoes Foundation in the protection and preservation of these artworks."

9789860734034,"保有一塊遠方的心靈淨土吧，那塊未遭破壞、常被忽略的淨土；保有在這世上一個別人無法到達的小小中心點吧，在那兒我們夢想著小小夢想——而時候一到，我們便再次進入大機器裡，緊咬住齒輪，且受「死亡輪」（thewheel）之酷刑。   在美國波士頓郊區聽重金屬音樂長大的丹．莫樂，有一天在母親的唱片架上出奇不意地發現了夾在肯尼．羅傑斯（Kenny Rogers）和「阿巴合唱團」（ABBA）十六首精選中間的《賦格的藝術》錄音，從此他的命運就起了變化。 成人學習鋼琴會引起兩種明顯相反的感覺。第一種是「荒謬感」，身為成年人卻要在這些幼稚的練習曲裡蹣跚學步，還領悟到原來我已落後人家數十年（一個開了竅的四歲幼兒竟遙遙領先於我）。想法很不美式的聖奧古斯丁（St.Augustine）曾說，清醒之人寧願死去也不願再回到童年，正在練習彈帽子舞的我只能大表同意。然而，另一種感覺則是有「深刻理解的喜悅」，那在我成年之前是不可能擁有的，再加上「真正去做事情的動力」，這些事情都是我小時候要被逼著才會去做的事。 音樂讓你與作曲家本人連通，讓他的力量與個性灌注於你，這就是除了彈巴哈以外，要彈其他人都令我難耐的部分原因，因為那就像是讓一個不相配的人住進我的身體裡，就像讓勉強戴上的手套占據了我的雙手一樣；相反地，在演奏我所學到的巴哈幾個小片段時，有好幾次的短暫瞬間，我覺得自己也在傳遞全世界的一切美好。我接下來幾年所設定的自我挑戰是，就算不能精通，我也要能彈得出「C小調賦格曲」…… 莫樂透過本書帶領我們進入 JS巴哈的世界，內容出乎世人意料地奇特有趣。 您是否知道《郭德堡變奏曲》中有一首關於吃很多大白菜的曲子？ 韓德爾曾經在指揮歌劇表演時，還得當場與人決鬥，還差點因此喪命？莫樂也在書中提及諸多疑問，例如巴哈音樂有何特別之處？ 追逐流行音樂的美國人可以從歐洲的「藝匠精神」當中學到什麼？ 為什麼有些人會覺得巴哈音樂與上帝（神）有關？   ※自學鋼琴的第一階段──荒謬感※  	 一個開了竅的四歲幼兒竟遙遙領先於我。	想法很不美式的聖奧古斯丁（St.Augustine）曾說，清醒之人寧願死去也不願再回到童年，正在練習彈帽子舞的我只能大表同意。	成人至少有的這個好處是，在他必須練習寫十四行詩之前就可以先墜入愛河了。	音樂與繪畫是完全不同的；我們只能遠距離欣賞如法國畫家馬奈「女神遊樂廳的吧檯」的偉大之處，但要成為其中的一部分是毫無指望的。	這一切都太荒謬，尤其當我想到——我生命的真正意義好似取決於能否像這樣把手指頭使勁下按。	我也意識到了自己的偽善；我會因為學生沒有去查每一個他們不確定的單字而對他們咆哮，如果在讀《伊利亞德》之前就先讀《奧德賽》我也會很氣……幾年下來，他們也沒有因為這樣就不再成長躍進——這可是令我相當火大的呢。    ※自學鋼琴的第二階段──深刻理解的喜悅※  	在演奏我所學到的巴哈幾個小片段時，有好幾次的短暫瞬間，我覺得自己也在傳遞全世界的一切美好。	在演奏樂器時，由於你就是創造聲音的人，因此你確實可以接近音樂的本質，或至少把音樂化為真實。	藉由你的手指這個工具，作曲家讓他的作品復活了，讓他的音樂具體存在了；在某一個瞬間，你的雙手就是他的雙手。	當我更專注地聆聽那四十八首前奏曲和賦格曲時，我逐漸明白巴哈最終要提出的觀點就是：有時候，追求純粹會限制你；不完美則有很多優點。	「接受不完美」為巴哈開創出新視野，他的音樂藉由調律變得靈活敏捷，讓他可以跨越調式，自在漫遊，並連接原本各自為政的領域。	巴哈盡善盡美的作品更像是維梅爾畫作中的那抹淺笑，或從他的窗戶照進來的光線質感，而非米開朗基羅那種豔麗色彩。	在巴哈身上，我注意到的是一種謙卑與自負的奇異組合，不僅令我著迷，也讓我希望能夠更了解他。    ※自學鋼琴的第三階段──真正去做事情的動力※  	這部作品中的顫音讓我認識到第一種我覺得身體結構不可能做得到的技巧。太讓人抓狂了。	是身心因果（Mental causation）問題讓我做不到的吧。於是我嚴厲地對著中指和食指皺了皺眉，發下可怕的詛咒，但它們依舊維持遲鈍的蠕蟲狀，彈出來的與其說是顫音，還不如說是無力呻吟。	有一次我發現前一天晚上幾乎不可能練好的樂段第二天就會彈了，此後，上述那些挫敗感就更叫人想不通了。	自從克里斯多福打開了我的雙耳以來，我便不忍心再寄給他我彈琴的錄音。替代做法是，我發給他簡短的片段、問題說明、尋求建議，而他總是不辭辛勞地回覆，也有許多洞見。	我開始比較注意起手指頭來了。不是盯著琴鍵或樂譜看，而是凝視著琴蓋的黑色鏡面所反映出來的雙手。	亮黑的琴身反映出我的雙手，我開始用音樂的語彙設想我所有的人際關係──    一天當中的每一次相遇都是在以另一種節拍，另一種和弦或不和諧音相迎，並逐步以反向動作離去，直到最後我們來到了「終止六四和弦」、V和弦，所有不和諧音都化為琴酒加通寧汽水，而我又回復孤身一人。  "

9781665584067,"Still in Chains is based on the historical facts of the mostly English-speaking Caribbean, with Grenada being the only anglophone island to have had a full-scale revolution, resulting in the demise of the revolution and subsequent invasion, or intervention by, American Forces. It focuses on the original inhabitants of the region, the coming of the Europeans, the introduction of slavery from Africa, and the struggle for emancipation. The book touches on the assistance from Cuba in the South African freedom struggle, the civil wars in Angola, Mozambique and Namibia, and how this resulted in the end of the Apartheid regime inside South Africa. This led to the freeing of Nelson Mandela - a significant element that played influence to the economic and political strategy of Grenada and the English-speaking Caribbean. As a young activist Clarence focused heavily on the black struggle, the fight against racism and the struggle for equal rights for all - a catalyst that led to his research into African and Caribbean history, slavery and the struggle of slave descendants throughout Europe, Africa and the Caribbean."

So, it's important to ask yourself: Are you on the right road?  Elvin C. Myers, a former missionary and pastor to churches in Colorado, Virginia, and Florida, wrote this book to steer people away from errors that might damn their souls.  The author draws on his more than sixty years of being a pastor to explore the differences between Protestant Evangelical beliefs and those of Catholicism. In doing so, he answers questions such as:  Why is it incumbent on people who know the truth of the Lord to speak up? Does living a good life ensure someone will go to heaven? What are the consequences of being disobedient to the Lord? Can someone who is deeply religious still perish in hell?  It is the author's sincere hope that this book will lead you away from the judgment of hell and the lake of fire that is mentioned in Revelation 20:14-15, a place where the soul never dies."

Even on the hottest summer days this book will transport you."" --Helen Macdonald, author of H is for Hawk, in Kirkus I saw my first Blakiston's fish owl in the Russian province of Primorye, a coastal talon of land hooking south into the belly of Northeast Asia . . . No scientist had seen a Blakiston's fish owl so far south in a hundred years . . .  When he was just a fledgling birdwatcher, Jonathan C. Slaght had a chance encounter with one of the most mysterious birds on Earth. Bigger than any owl he knew, it looked like a small bear with decorative feathers. He snapped a quick photo and shared it with experts. Soon he was on a five-year journey, searching for this enormous, enigmatic creature in the lush, remote forests of eastern Russia. That first sighting set his calling as a scientist. Despite a wingspan of six feet and a height of over two feet, the Blakiston's fish owl is highly elusive. They are easiest to find in winter, when their tracks mark the snowy banks of the rivers where they feed. They are also endangered. And so, as Slaght and his devoted team set out to locate the owls, they aim to craft a conservation plan that helps ensure the species' survival. This quest sends them on all-night monitoring missions in freezing tents, mad dashes across thawing rivers, and free-climbs up rotting trees to check nests for precious eggs. They use cutting-edge tracking technology and improvise ingenious traps. And all along, they must keep watch against a run-in with a bear or an Amur tiger. At the heart of Slaght's story are the fish owls themselves: cunning hunters, devoted parents, singers of eerie duets, and survivors in a harsh and shrinking habitat. Through this rare glimpse into the everyday life of a field scientist and conservationist, Owls of the Eastern Ice testifies to the determination and creativity essential to scientific advancement and serves as a powerful reminder of the beauty, strength, and vulnerability of the natural world."

The season of Advent offers time and space for Christians to prepare for the coming of Jesus Christ at Christmas through reflecting on the story of salvation. In All the Good: A Wesleyan Way of Christmas, a group of diverse Wesleyan scholars will take you on an Advent journey guided by the practices in John Wesley's means of grace. John Wesley's emphasis upon practices of piety and mercy--or good works--drew from the larger Christian tradition. Such practices are often referred to as means of grace. Each chapter guides participants through one of the four weeks of Advent by reflecting on biblical passages in light of an aspect of Wesleyan means of grace highlighted by illustrations and stories. Readers will look at preparing the way for God, the impact and significance of prayer, the substance of good works and caring for others, and sharing God's mission to the world. In this season of Advent as we await the birth of the Christ child remember and know God's goodness and love for us. A DVD with weekly video segments and a comprehensive Leader Guide with small-group discussion questions are available separately to create a four-week study for Advent."

9780367311001,"This study traces the rise of Kampuchean communism from its inception in 1930 to the present. The author analyzes the socioeconomic and political conditions that brought Cambodia to an explosive stage in 1970 and documents the cataclysmic transformation that followed. The protagonist in this ongoing historical drama is the revolutionary movement known as the Khmer Rouge, or Red Khmers. Their revolution was so ultraradical that even the communists were appalled. The Soviets studiously ignored it, the Chinese vainly tried to moderate it, and the Vietnamese ultimately destroyed it. In an attempt to explain the Khmer revolution--one of the most violent in modern political history--the author focuses on the ideology created by a key group of Khmer Rouge leaders. The theoretical and historical significance of the Khmer revolution and the state of Democratic Kampuchea has received little attention from scholars, and far too much of what has been written has been motivated by a bewildering array of ideological and geopolitical interests. This book is one of the first to apply a systematic analytical framework to the creation, growth, and destruction of Democratic Kampuchea."

In a preface to each interview, the editors analyze the conditions for CEA effectiveness, look at how well the advice of the Council has conformed to the presidential world view, and pinpoint the distribution of responsibility for policy analysis and advice within successive administrations."
9780367311216,"How can culture and experience be conceptualized when theorists drag social meaning back and forth between institutions, objects, or acts, as if the dense communication between persons and things were only a quick exchange between surfaces? This volume challenges mentalist approaches to material culture through the historical and ethnographic analyses of sensory memory. The sensory landscape and its meaning-endowed objects bear within them emotional and historical sedimentation that pose crucial questions: What cultural practices enable the sensory-affective experience of history? How does the history of perception speak to the perception of history? The editor, in her four essays, discusses sensory memory as a cultural form not limited to the psychic apparatus of a monadic, pre-cultural, and ahistorical subject but embedded and embodied in a dispersed surround of created things, surfaces, depths, and densities that are stratigraphic sites of sensory biography and history. The volume demonstrates that any ethnographic discussion of the senses involves a priori claims about modernity. Thus the senses are explored in contemporary political and racial violence, exchange practices, the emotions, national identity, food-ways, spatial organization, leisure activity, and the electronic media. Well-known authors examine personal and social investments in objects and substances as the tip of a submerged collective language of materiality that firmly grasps the mutable structure of contemporary experience. Social memory is treated as a meta-sensory organ and shown to be a culturally mediated performance that is activated by material acts and emotionally tangible artifacts."

9780367305802,"The 1988 elections abruptly brought the importance of religion in American politics into sharp focus. Two ministers, Pat Robertson and Jesse Jackson, sought their party's presidential nominations by mobilizing key religious constituencies. In addition, a host of other religious groups, from the Catholic bishops to the Jewish community, sought to influence the election outcome. More than ever, religion was a critical factor in the ballots cast by millions of Americans. As the twentieth century draws to a close, it is clear that religion will continue to be a powerful factor in electoral politics. This volume investigates the many ways religion influenced electoral politics in 1988, tracing the links between elites, activists, and voters in the major religious traditions. Special attention is paid to the leaders of Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish organizations; to important sets of activists, such as ministers, party leaders, and campaign contributors; and to the behavior of key voting blocs, including white evangelical and mainline Protestants, black Protestants, Catholics, and Jews."

This book examines the processes of technology transfer and development by tracing how Hindustan Machine Tools--a public enterprise in India--successfully collaborated with manufacturers from industrialized nations in its growth from a single factory to a diversified industrial complex. The author critically analyzes the company's overall strategies for diversification and expansion and its approaches to selecting, acquiring, absorbing, and generating technology and to developing appropriate management. He also points to important relationships between â oepolicy efficiencyâ  and â oeadministrative efficiencyâ  and discusses socioeconomic and cultural factors that can obstruct the successful development and operation of an industrial enterprise in a developing country."

9780367311254,"Although formal social impact assessment of changing technologies in U.S. agriculture is still in its infancy, scholars have been documenting the effects of new technology throughout the twentieth century. In this collection, Prcfessors Berardi and Geisler bring together historically relevant research and a carefully chosen cross section of contemporary work. Their review of the literature is followed by an evaluation of the effects of mechanization on labor and production, written in 1904, which provides a backdrop for papers from the 1940s and 1950s examining the mechanization of agriculture in the South, in the Midwest, and in rural areas in general. Subsequent chapters offer present-day insights on such topics as the socioeconomic consequences of automated vegetable and tobacco harvesting, center-pivot irrigation, and organic and no-till cultivation. The authors also look at compensation and adjustment programs for displaced labor, the relationship between technology and agribusiness growth, and the effectiveness of university programs that prepare students to perform social impact assessments in agriculture. The edited proceedings of a spirited roundtable discussion on new directions for the study of the social impacts of farm technology and the political economy of agriculture provide the thought-provoking conclusion to this overview of the field."

9780367299392,"Two basic processes--industrialization and the emergence of the nation-state--have marked the evolution of many modern societies, particularly in Western Europe. Industrialization broadened the class structure of societies. With the new classes came demands for political power and influence, demands that were vigorously resisted by the ruling monarchies and landowning aristocracies. And with these demands came upheaval and, eventually, new forms of democratic social and political organization. In Portugal's transition from absolutist monarchy to pluralist democracy can be found an example of these transformative processes at work. Yet the experience of this nation has been largely neglected in discussions of Western European politics. With Portugal: From Monarchy to Pluralist Democracy, Walter C. Opello, Jr., brings the transformation of Portugal into sharp focus and, in doing so, offers interesting insights into the problems of forming a democratic regime. This profile traces Portugal's transition to democracy within the broader context of its historical development as a nation-state, documenting the effects of absolutism, imperialism, centralization, class and regional cleavages, and late industrialization on the Portuguese people, their polity, economy, and society. Exploring the themes that have shaped the development of Portugal's democratic structures, Professor Opello also assesses the future viability of these structures in light of the country's nondemocratic legacies."

While you're penetrating her, you can reach your hand underneath and rub her clitoris with it while you're deep inside of her. This will really encourage an orgasm and you'll be able to see how she responds to this type of sexual activity. You also may be able to pleasure your man more by purchasing different types of lubricant that will allow him to go deeper inside of you.Every one of us is born with the potential to experience great sensual pleasure. Our bodies are made for pleasure. Every sensory organ has the capacity to stimulate us to profound states of ecstasy, whether through sight, sound, taste, smell, or touch.Sexual love is certainly an important component of our lives, especially in certain times of the year and certain stages of life. Hormones go crazy, the attraction gets stronger and sex - and more generally sexuality - sometimes seems to be the only thing that can give us some relief. But, in addition to being beneficial, sex and sexuality are also fun and can be experienced through games. To prove it, if needed, we can have a look at the many erotic games that humanity has invented over the centuries.With that, we're basically saying that you need to stay healthy in order to fully enjoy the benefits of a healthy sex life. Don't forget to use protection at all times unless you are planning on having a baby.It is also advisable to submit yourself for testing if you engage in sex with multiple partners. Remember: a little bit of prevention is better than a pound of cure!This book covers: - What Is Intimacy- The Kama Sutra- How to Prepare the Mind and Body for Sex- Unlocking Your Sexual Fantasies and Fetishes- What is a Sexual Fantasy?- What Is a Fetish and What Is a Kink?- Tantric Sex- Aphrodisiacs- Sex Toys- Sex Positions- Positions for His Pleasure- Positions for Her Pleasure- How to Last Longer- Intimacy Beyond The Bedroom- How to Apply What You Have Learned- CommunicationAnd Much More!Buy it NOW and let your customers get addicted to this amazing book!"

It provides a modular codebase and advanced tools which help developers to build compilers easily. This book provides a practical introduction to LLVM, gradually helping you navigate through complex scenarios with ease when it comes to building and working with compilers.You'll start by configuring, building, and installing LLVM libraries, tools, and external projects. Next, the book will introduce you to LLVM design and how it works in practice during each LLVM compiler stage: frontend, optimizer, and backend. Using a subset of a real programming language as an example, you will then learn how to develop a frontend and generate LLVM IR, hand it over to the optimization pipeline, and generate machine code from it. Later chapters will show you how to extend LLVM with a new pass and how instruction selection in LLVM works. You'll also focus on Just-in-Time compilation issues and the current state of JIT-compilation support that LLVM provides, before finally going on to understand how to develop a new backend for LLVM.By the end of this LLVM book, you will have gained real-world experience in working with the LLVM compiler development framework with the help of hands-on examples and source code snippets.What You Will Learn:  Configure, compile, and install the LLVM frameworkUnderstand how the LLVM source is organizedDiscover what you need to do to use LLVM in your own projectsExplore how a compiler is structured, and implement a tiny compilerGenerate LLVM IR for common source language constructsSet up an optimization pipeline and tailor it for your own needsExtend LLVM with transformation passes and clang toolingAdd new machine instructions and a complete backendWho this book is for: This book is for compiler developers, enthusiasts, and engineers who are new to LLVM and are interested in learning about the LLVM framework. It is also useful for C++ software engineers looking to use compiler-based tools for code analysis and improvement, as well as casual users of LLVM libraries who want to gain more knowledge of LLVM essentials.

The present collection comprises chapters dedicated to the figure of Rome as an Arcadia-city: like ideal consular roads, these papers develop into varied thematic branches, even though they all have the same starting, or ending, point - the city of Rome, analyzed from the point of view of its architectural, historical or symbolic value. One ideal ""road"" of discussion starts in Poland, another ""road"" passes through England, a third ideally combines Greece and Russia; yet another ideal discussion ""road"" originates from the ancient Roman myths, runs through the 16th century and reaches the fin de siècle and the 20th century."

I grew up in a time before Phonics was practised in schools. Readers had key sight words and a big reliance on the picture for you to decode the rest of the words in the sentence. ﻿Phonemic awareness is important because English is not a phonetic language. It always appears to break the rules which then leaves children confused. By teaching them how to decode words you are handing them the magic key that unlocks the hidden world contained in every book. "

9781612008813,"Go buy this book right now. It is rare that ISD gives an instant five-star rating to any new volume, but Mark C. Wilkins' British Fighter Aircraft in World War I is a rare book. -- Indy Squadron DispatchWorld War I witnessed unprecedented growth and innovation in aircraft design, construction, and as the war progressed--mass production. Each country generated its own innovations sometimes in surprising ways--Albatros Fokker, Pfalz, and Junkers in Germany and Nieuport, Spad, Sopwith and Bristol in France and Britain.This book focuses on the British approach to fighter design, construction, and mass production. Initially the French led the way in Allied fighter development with their Bleriot trainers then nimble Nieuport Scouts--culminating with the powerful, fast gun platforms as exemplified by the Spads. The Spads had a major drawback however, in that they were difficult and counter-intuitive to fix in the field. The British developed fighters in a very different way; Tommy Sopwith had a distinctive approach to fighter design that relied on lightly loaded wings and simple functional box-girder fuselages. His Camel was revolutionary as it combined all the weight well forward; enabling the Camel to turn very quickly--but also making it an unforgiving fighter for the inexperienced. The Royal Aircraft Factory's SE5a represented another leap forward with its comfortable cockpit, modern instrumentation, and inline engine--clearly influenced by both Spads and German aircraft.Each manufacturer and design team vied for the upper hand and deftly and quickly appropriated good ideas from other companies--be they friend or foe. Developments in tactics and deployment also influenced design--from the early reconnaissance planes, to turn fighters, finally planes that relied upon formation tactics, speed, and firepower. Advances were so great that the postwar industry seemed bland by comparison."
9780578897943,"When we hear of Jamaica or the Caribbean, we think of beautiful islands of paradise with sun, sea and sand, reggae music, cannabis, and ""irie"" people like Usain Bolt- people who are living out their best dreams, desires, and lives. But this book analyzes this motif, given the historical and current economic and political situation in Jamaica and the Caribbean and the ""Global South."" In an attempt to escape the adverse realities of poverty, inequality, and injustice, the people of the Global South find themselves in north metropolises with very little agency and minimal change to their lives. In fact, except for the use of cleaning neoliberal waste, the immigrant is usually portrayed as an alien with three heads and big sharp teeth seeking to steal and destroy the profit and disrupt society. As such we will discuss Black, brown, and Pan-African struggles for economic prosperity, justice, and freedom and consider efforts, abilities, or inabilities to chart their own futures since decolonization and realize real political independence and economic prosperity. Perhaps, they are charting their own course by the few corrupt of the status quo who are benefiting from partnerships with the neoliberal regime of the ""Washington Consensus,"" advocates of the ""bureaucratic phenomenon,"" while the masses are left behind. John Williamson, the inventor of the term ""Washington Consensus,"" believes the term has two quite different meanings. First is the meaning he gave the term, which involved consensus around a set of ten policy reforms, which he believed were widely accepted as beneficial by economists.The approach will be interdisciplinary and comprehensive, drawing on various disciplines and experiences and going beyond Jamaica to consider the wider Caribbean and the diaspora in the United States. It draws on past and present works on the subject and relies on readers' abilities, knowledge (primary or secondary), and skills to challenge, critically analyze, and develop their own thinking within a Jamaican, Caribbean, its diaspora, and/or American context given this century's challenges and opportunities. This Book is divided into two parts. Part A will examine whether Jamaica's inequality trends from the mid-1970s up to the beginning of the twenty-first century were a consequence of the structural adjustment policies stipulated by the neoliberal technocrats of the Washington Consensus in Jamaica. The study does not only concern itself with Jamaica, but Jamaica provides a case and a context within which to engage the subject matter. ﻿Part B will argue, given Jamaica's experience with neoliberal restructuring, that Jamaica-like many former colonies-is far from independent. Further, we will consider the response to the processes of decolonization and globalization that have deepened the realities of the peoples of the Global South and the peoples in the diaspora. There have been hundreds of protests against the Washington Consensus and their lackeys since 1976 by the global justice movement and recently the Black Lives Matter movement in America. Street protests and some degree of violence have been the main strategies of the group until recently. But are the resistance movements closer to achieving their aims? The effectiveness of the resistance will be determined by the extent to which they have realized actual power: ""demonstrated change in the desired direction."""

9781662908026,"As punctuated through recent events, societal perceptions are that American policing continues to fail in its mission, to protect and preserve. Whether because of institutionalized prejudices that emphasize an ""us versus them"" mentality, reinforced through warrior training tactics, or poor recruiting, training, leadership and discipline, or a combination of these factors, the police profession continues to be challenged in its mission to deliver police services to the very citizens they swore to serve.The challenge now is to recognize the profession's shortcomings regarding indifference, negligence, intentional acts and their cover-ups and the costs associated with such unconstitutional policing tactics. We must all learn from them, police and citizens alike, to better police service and citizen expectations. These are preventable, compensable acts of liability that are the direct result of inadequate legal training, poor supervision, dysfunctional police organizations and occupational prejudices against the disenfranchised, the marginalized and the less fortunate.The profession must focus on comprehensively training the next generation of officers regarding these breaches of duty that dilute the public's trust in their law enforcement. As well, civic leaders and citizens must appreciate what and how costly unconstitutional police acts are and hold their agencies accountable for such malpractice. Such acts taint the profession, tarnish the public's perceptions, cost taxpayers exponentially in jury awards and settlements and deplete a department's morale.Noble integrity is a training concept that defines and refines the balance between the constitutional limitations of badge authority with the guardian/warrior mindset, demonstrated through an oath-based training approach. It exemplifies the Intelligence Led Policing philosophies of self-policing, Unit policing, whisteblowing, audits and purges and hierarchical accountability. By referencing U.S. Supreme Court cases the reader is better educated in the nuances and standards of constitutional police procedures, coupled with police malpractice incidents that have cost officers their jobs, department's the public's trust and municipalities in crippling legal fees. ""Doing the noble thing"" must be the standard and mantra for 21st century policing to begin the police-community healing. But it is the police profession that must begin this healing process in changing its officers' mindset.The challenge today is enlightening, thus empowering, all students of policing as to the legal and ethical standards our police officers must be held to in order to improve police-community relations and reduce municipal civil liability. This includes, but is not limited to discussions regarding Constitutional Law, Qualified Immunity, De-escalation measures, Violations of the Oath of Office, the temptations of the profession and national de-certification indexes. Quality of character matters in all facets of policing and is a defense to allegations of police malpractice and breaches of the oath."

9781620975237,"In the tradition of Eric Schlosser's Fast Food Nation, a groundbreaking global investigation into the industry ravaging the environment and global health--from the James Beard Award-winning journalist Over the past few decades, palm oil has seeped into every corner of our lives. Worldwide, palm oil production has nearly doubled in just the last decade: oil-palm plantations now cover an area nearly the size of New Zealand, and some form of the commodity lurks in half the products on U.S. grocery shelves. But the palm oil revolution has been built on stolen land and slave labor; it's swept away cultures and so devastated the landscapes of Southeast Asia that iconic animals now teeter on the brink of extinction. Fires lit to clear the way for plantations spew carbon emissions to rival those of industrialized nations. James Beard Award-winning journalist Jocelyn C. Zuckerman spent years traveling the globe, from Liberia to Indonesia, India to Brazil, reporting on the human and environmental impacts of this poorly understood plant. The result is Planet Palm, a riveting account blending history, science, politics, and food as seen through the people whose lives have been upended by this hidden ingredient. This groundbreaking work of first-rate journalism compels us to examine the connections between the choices we make at the grocery store and a planet under siege."

9781630061333,"""Monsignor Franco is known as an engaging storyteller of his impactful time in the Church. Read this book and you will see why."" -- Timothy Cardinal Dolan, Archdiocese of New York Six Popes: A Son of the Church Remembers is Monsignor Hilary C. Franco's engaging memoir and a story only a son can tell, a son not only of the Catholic Church, but also of Italian immigrants. From Belmont, his Bronx neighborhood, Franco rose to work with the highest and most influential figures of the Roman Catholic Church. As a young man he attended Rome's premier seminary, soon after becoming the special assistant to Archbishop Fulton Sheen. As a priest he would travel the world, and he recounts a harrowing experience in the Deep South in the early 1960s, his work at the Vatican Councils that redefined the Church, and his time posted at the Church's diplomatic missions in Washington, D.C., and the United Nations. This most formidable churchman reveals his tales of intellectual, pastoral, and diplomatic service to the Catholic Church, enlivened by recollections of the fascinating people he came to know from U.S. presidents and foreign heads of state, to religious leaders like Padre Pio and Saint Mother Teresa. The title of his current role, Advisor at the Permanent Observer Mission of the Holy See to the United Nations, gives little hint of the drama of the times he recollects. Stories of this book's six pontiffs that Franco served under -- John XXIII, Paul VI, John Paul I, John Paul II, Benedict XVI, Francis -- offer landmarks along Franco's trek through the corridors of spiritual power in New York, Washington, D.C., and Rome. Six Popes: A Son of the Church Remembers is written from a unique eyewitness vantage on many of the events and movements that shaped our world and the Catholic Church. There is really no other book like it."

But that doesn't mean she has a problem, right?Finding herself between jobs, Charlotte fills her time teaching crafting skills at the local nursing home. Encouraged by how positively the residents respond, the possibility of a career doing what she adores fills her mind.The first step towards that ambition is creating a crafting hub for the community - The Crafternoon Sewcial Club.When a local charity announces a major knitting-themed fundraiser, Charlotte sees the ideal stage to put her new club firmly on the crafting map and drum up new members in the process.Unfortunately, not everybody is on board with her vision for a crafting club, as it turns out. Indeed, some are even hoping to see Charlotte's dream come crashing down around her.Still, she won't let a minor issue like that derail her plans...To ensure victory, then, she'll need to rally her new members and ask her friends from the nursing home to get those needles clicking faster than a hummingbird's wings!If you adore crafting, knitting, sewing, crochet while drinking tea with friends, you'll love this book!"

9783030709556,"B-series, also known as Butcher series, are an algebraic tool for analysing solutions to ordinary differential equations, including approximate solutions. Through the formulation and manipulation of these series, properties of numerical methods can be assessed. Runge-Kutta methods, in particular, depend on B-series for a clean and elegant approach to the derivation of high order and efficient methods. However, the utility of B-series goes much further and opens a path to the design and construction of highly accurate and efficient multivalue methods. This book offers a self-contained introduction to B-series by a pioneer of the subject. After a preliminary chapter providing background on differential equations and numerical methods, a broad exposition of graphs and trees is presented. This is essential preparation for the third chapter, in which the main ideas of B-series are introduced and developed. In chapter four, algebraic aspects are further analysed in the context of integration methods, a generalization of Runge-Kutta methods to infinite index sets. Chapter five, on explicit and implicit Runge-Kutta methods, contrasts the B-series and classical approaches. Chapter six, on multivalue methods, gives a traditional review of linear multistep methods and expands this to general linear methods, for which the B-series approach is both natural and essential. The final chapter introduces some aspects of geometric integration, from a B-series point of view. Placing B-series at the centre of its most important applications makes this book an invaluable resource for scientists, engineers and mathematicians who depend on computational modelling, not to mention computational scientists who carry out research on numerical methods in differential equations. In addition to exercises with solutions and study notes, a number of open-ended projects are suggested. This combination makes the book ideal as a textbook for specialised courses on numerical methods for differential equations, as well as suitable for self-study."

Ils évitent toutefois de s'immiscer dans la vie des humains, préférant tenir ces derniers à une saine distance.Tout élémentaire sait bien qu'une ingérence irréfléchie n'est pas sans danger. Mais Tompym est encore un jeune lutin, peut-être plus curieux que les autres et sans doute un peu inconscient.Un appel déconcertant, une destination encore inconnue, la perspective d'une étrange rencontre... Il ne lui en faut pas plus pour se laisser entraîner dans une aventure qui lui réservera bien des surprises !"

Among these, the freedom to pursue happiness.That's an inalienable right each of us have. Something we were born with. It cannot be taken. It can only be given away.And everytime you get something new, it's something that identifies you. But too many people are afraid of losing that identity.

In her exciting new book, Rebecca C. Bartel details how surging evangelical conversions and widespread access to credit cards, microfinance programs, and mortgages are changing how millions of Colombians envision a more prosperous future. Yet programs of financialization propel new modes of violence. As prosperity becomes conflated with peace, and debt with devotion, survival only becomes possible through credit and its accompanying forms of indebtedness. A new future is on the horizon, but it will come at a price."

9781803019109,"Do you want to understand and learn Scrum? Your Customers Will Never Stop to Read and Read Again this Awesome Book!Scrum is possibly the very first thing that people think about when someone mentions Agile. It's no coincidence, and this is the most frequently used framework that teams use. It provides the highest possible value for products, allows developers to quickly and decisively adapt to changes, and keeps them productive. Mostly, it's a project management super tool, and that has led to many companies using some core Scrum tools outside of software development. Scrum is very different from the other Agile methodologies in that it has a very strict framework, with specific roles and explicit events. There are rules in place, and there are right and wrong ways of handling change events.Product Owners love Scrum because they know exactly what to expect from their software developer team even when they're entirely new to development. Working with developers, as a Product Owner, can be a struggle, to say the least. Imagine working with a team that must create a product that you could not possibly begin to put together. Scrum uses a combination of face-to-face conversation, documentation, and breaking the project into tiny parts. With this framework, there is no room for issues with communication, or for overlooking some aspect of the project.

9781008930681,"**55% OFF for Bookstores!! LAST DAYS***You have certainly heard of intermittent fasting and the benefits it has brought to so many people. You may not know, however, that the secret to the success of intermittent fasting is in the strengthening of Autophagy. Every day, our cells undergo a natural cleansing process called ""Autophagy"", which means that healthy cells devour old and weak ones, allowing the body to detoxify and renew itself.This is demonstrated by scientific data and is not a trend of recent years, but was already practiced by our ancestors, albeit unconsciously.With this book, I want to provide you with the tested methods by which you can activate autophagy in your body, and this not only to succeed in losing weight, but also to promote healing, slow aging and leave your body free from the chronic diseases that afflict millions of people. Specifically, I will dig deep into intermittent fasting and the 16/8 method, which is the simplest way to achieve autophagy, and the safest way to fast for those who are planning to do it for the first time."

9781783276080,"Motets constitute the most important polyphonic genre of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Moreover, these compositions are intrinsically involved in the early development of polyphony. This volume - the first to be devotedexclusively to medieval motets - aims to provide a comprehensive guide to them, from a number of different disciplines and perspectives. It addresses crucial matters such as how the motet developed; the rich interplay of musical, poetic, and intertextual modes of meaning specific to the genre; and the changing social and historical circumstances surrounding motets in medieval France, England, and Italy. It also seeks to question many traditional assumptions and received opinions in the area.The first part of the book considers core concepts in motet scholarship: issues of genre, relationships between the motet and other musico-poetic forms, tenor organization, isorhythm, notational development, social functions, and manuscript layout. This is followed by a series of individual case studies which look in detail at a variety of specific pieces, compositional techniques, collections, and subgenres"

9781801798884,"Uncinetto: dal passatempo da ""nonne"" al trend del momento.Se sei atterrato qui, significa che l'affascinante arte dell'uncinetto ha suscitato la tua curiosità. Sbaglio? Specialmente negli ultimi tempi, sono sempre più numerose le persone che hanno deciso di dedicarsi a questa tecnica che rappresenta il trend del momento: parliamo non più del passatempo delle nonne, ma dell'hobby preferito da tanti personaggi famosi!Per questo motivo ho pensato di partire dalle origini, con una parte del libro dedicata alla storia dell'uncinetto e alle sue evoluzioni, cosicché possa focalizzare meglio il contesto in cui la tecnica si colloca; proseguirò con la descrizione dei punti base, le decorazioni che potrai realizzare e diversi progetti per dare sfogo alla tua fantasia.Non voglio farti promesse irrealizzabili: questo manuale, al termine della lettura, non ti renderà un professionista. Tuttavia, al suo interno troverai tutto ciò di cui hai bisogno per capire, con un linguaggio semplice e scorrevole in cosa questa tecnica consiste: imparerai come si tiene l'uncinetto, che tipo di filato utilizzare, ma non solo; troverai tantissimi consigli dedicati a chi si affaccia per la prima volta al mondo dell'uncinetto. I suggerimenti ti torneranno molto utili per evitare una serie di errori in cui in genere si incorre, e soprattutto a rendere il lavoro più piacevole e divertente. Quindi, non temere, tutti possiamo imparare, e questo è uno di quei casi in cui, per creare qualcosa di solamente tuo avrai bisogno di due sole cose, un uncinetto, e un gomitolo di lana. Se sei curioso di andare più in fondo alla lettura di questo manuale, ti propongo di seguito i principali temi del libro: ●Storia dell'uncinetto. Qui scoprirai dov'è nata l'affascinante arte dell'uncinetto, da chi era utilizzata centinaia di anni fa, i materiali principali e le decorazioni; ●Punti base fondamentali. Temi che l'uncinetto sia un lavoro troppo complesso? Grazie ai punti base scoprirai che non è così. Una volta che avrai imparato le tecniche fondamentali, composte da passaggi brevi e scorrevoli, ti basterà la combinazione di qualche punto per creare tutto ciò che desideri; ●Suggerimenti per principianti. Essendo approdato qui, probabilmente troverai questo argomento molto interessante. All'interno della guida troverai tantissimi consigli sugli uncinetti migliori, su come ridare vita a un maglione dismesso, la tensione esercitata sull'uncinetto durante il lavoro, e tanto altro ancora;●Strumenti e materiali. Dato che sei alle prime armi, probabilmente ti domanderai quale possa essere il tessuto migliore, quello più facile da lavorare, o l'uncinetto più adatto a te. Sbaglio?La guida fugherà ogni dubbio, dandoti i migliori suggerimenti sulle tipologie di filato presenti sul mercato, come risparmiare, cosa scegliere per ogni progetto... e chi più ne ha più ne metta!●Tanti progetti differenti. Alla fine del libro potrai sbizzarrirti con i progetti che preferisci: pupazzi, sciarpe, tovagliette realizzabili con pochi punti... non ti verranno chieste abilità da professionista.Arrivati a questo punto, anche se non hai mai sfiorato l'uncinetto, ti basterà davvero poco tempo per poter apprendere le nozioni di base e dar vita ai tuoi progetti handmade. Se inoltre pensi di poterti scoraggiare a metà dell'opera, ricorda che grazie a questo libro non correrai questo rischio, i suggerimenti ti consentiranno di evitare gli errori ancor prima di commetterli. Se sei alla ricerca di un manuale sull'uncinetto per principianti, cosa aspetti? I tuoi clienti non smetteranno di leggere questo fantastico libro !!!"

9781640654358,"Can the 'reality' of the Eucharist be maintained online?Author C. Andrew Doyle, in a well-researched and thoughtful study of both virtual reality and liturgy, argues that the Eucharist is not a formulaic rehearsal of words and rituals but an embodied and lived experience. This requires a shared place and presence. While the church should not shy away from virtual ministry, we should be wary of using the technological realm for the celebration of the Eucharist, an act that is an outward and visible sign of our spiritual union with God and one another. It brings us closer to friend and stranger for the transformation of individuals into unity in Christ. The context of the ritual-with people, objects, words, and all sorts of nuance-creates intimacy with God and each other.This unique book is especially timely and will be of interest to scholars, liturgists, and those interested in sacramental theology in the digital age."
9788269235913,"A modern woman scares people. Her drive, her ambition, her independence. She's an enigma, and people often hate what they don't understand. But, to William, she's the perfect woman, and he will stop at nothing to solve the mystery of her.Cara is a top law student in London. She's got her life together and is dead set on realising her ambitions, so finding a romantic partner is not among her priorities - at least for now. Besides, she's whole all on her own - she doesn't need a man in order to feel complete. With loyal, genuine friends, a supportive family and an overall comfortable lifestyle, Cara is happy with her life as it is. So, when William crosses her path, it throws a real spanner in the works.The dashing lawyer boasts the most merciless tongue Cara has ever come across, whether it's in debate or in bed. Blunt and sharply clever, he ticks every box, and even adds some of his own - things Cara never knew she desired in a man. Before long, he puts her convictions on trial, and he drives a ferocious prosecution. Cara finds it hard to resist him, but being together could have disastrous consequences. If William wins the trial, she may lose more than just her heart.Packed with complex characters, steamy scenes and cheeky dialogue, The Night series is sure to bring you on a journey of laughter, frustration, tears, and deep reflections you won't forget anytime soon.WARNING: This is not your typical romance story. This is a book that aims to challenge the norm and expose gender bias ingrained in the subject of romance.Furthermore, this series has a particular focus on character complexity and development. It is not a plot-driven story.This book contains several sexually explicit scenes. It is intended for mature audiences. Skin of the Night is the first book in The Night series."

9781913622558,"In the last 20 years, the cognitive sciences have revealed fresh, surprising, and useful insights into how and why our students learn. Teachers can now draw on psychology and neuroscience research to supplement, reconsider, even overturn our traditions and training. To use this research most wisely, teachers must find our way to an elusive Goldilocks Zone. Instead of resisting all research-based guidance, we should be ready to take it to heart - even when it challenges both our training and conventional wisdom. Instead of accepting all research-based guidance, we should be ready to reject it emphatically - especially the hyped-up edu-fads that exaggerate and misinterpret psychology findings. How can we get this Goldilocks balance ""just right""? This book offers a specific, practical quest map to discover just such a balance. By critically examining the source, the research, and ourselves, teachers can develop the skills necessary to be effective research skeptics. Written by a teacher with 18 years in the classroom - and 13 years studying neuroscience and psychology - The Goldilocks Map transforms brain research from a daunting monologue into an approachable, exciting, and lively conversation."

Estes números astronômicos tornam o câncer uma das principais causas de morte no mundo, e com 1 em cada 4 mortes nos Estados Unidos atribuídas ao Câncer, é a segunda principal causa de morte apenas na América. Com as causas do câncer variando de uso do tabaco até peso em excesso, uma teoria sugere que os níveis de acidez e alcalinidade no corpo também são um fator importante. Alta acidez está ligada a condições piores de saúde, enquanto um nível mais neutro e alcalino está associado a uma saúde mais favorável e maior. A ciência está dando uma boa olhada em maneiras de neutralizar a acidez crescente das pessoas no mundo todo, com alguns estudos focando o bicarbonato de sódio como uma ferramenta que pode ser usada para aumentar o estado preferível alcalino do corpo. Este guia explora os muitos usos e potenciais benefícios de adicionar o bicarbonato de sódio à sua dieta diária; de quanto usar, quando usar, como ingerir, os benefícios e os potenciais efeitos colaterais, todas as perguntas são respondidas e explicadas em detalhes.

9783030445829,"Sitting at the nexus of labor migration and health care work, this book examines the dynamic relationship between nurses' cross-border movement and efforts to regulate their migration. Grounded in multi-sited qualitative research, this volume analyzes the changing social dimensions and transnational scale of global nursing, focusing particularly on the recruitment from the Philippines to Germany. The flow of nursing skills from resource-poor countries to well-off ones is not only producing a global care crisis, but also serves as a prime example of the international race for talent and skill. As it takes a critical eye to the emerging field of migration governance or management as the preferred policy response to competing discourses of global care crises and the global competition for skilled care work, this book highlights not only the shifting web of actors, discourses, and practices in care work migration management, but also, and more importantly, how various forms of care figure in the global migration of nurses."

9798749449730,"This book presents practical geometry algorithms with computationally fast C++ code implementations. It covers algorithms for fundamental geometric objects, such as points, lines, rays, segments, triangles, polygons, and planes. These algorithms determine the basic 2D and 3D properties, such as area, distance, inclusion, and intersections. There are also algorithms to compute bounding containers for these objects, including a fast bounding ball, various convex hull algorithms, as well as polygon extreme points and tangents. And there is a fast algorithm for polyline simplification using decimation that works in any dimension.These algorithms have been used in practice for several decades. They are robust, easy to understand, code, and maintain. And they execute very rapidly in practice, not just in theory. For example, the winding number point in polygon inclusion test, first developed by the author in 2000, is the fastest inclusion algorithm known, and works correctly even for non-simple polygons. Also, there is a fast implementation of the Melkman algorithm for the convex hull of a simple polyline. And much more.If your programming involves geometry, this book will be an invaluable reference. Further, along with the book, there is a free download of all the C++ code from the book, plus some additional supporting code."

9798504085470,"(c) Chisokudō Publications 2021This engaging book challenges both uncritical devotees and critical historians of Zen for the ways they have misplaced truths in the tradition known by that name. It first shows how current Chan/Zen scholarship itself is a practice that echoes the legendary verse about Zen as a ""separate transmission outside the scriptures, not relying on written words,"" and then it develops the category of legend as an alternative to both history and myth, fact and fabrication. The author not only analyzes the different meanings of ""transmission""; he also clarifies what historically was dependent upon the transmissions. He suggests new approaches to the study of Zen rituals and relics as well as Zen texts, while also recalling an essential sense of Zen that eludes texts. The Saga of Zen History is a paradigm-changing work, one that that makes critical scholarship more responsive to self-examination and one that is also accessible to general readers.Also available as an Apple iBook."

9781643962054,"Artists are only those famous creators in glamorous metropolises like New York City and Hollywood. Successful artists are only those on the New York Times' Bestseller List or Billboard Charts. And everyone else is merely a hobbyist, right? Wrong. In Abandoning the Road to Hollywood, author René C. McMillen leads artists down the path less explored--that of the small town creative. With grace, humor, and verve, McMillen shows how artists can embrace their true selves and be wildly successful in no-name towns and overlooked suburbs. She shares her own story of landing in the windswept plains of Wyoming and--like a hardy English rose--persevering to find artistic efflorescence of productivity and prosperity. Along the way, she weaves in interviews with numerous artists who share their inspiring stories and offer sound advice to creative souls. If you're ready to embrace your true artistic self no matter where you are in life, then this book is for you. Praise for ABANDONING THE ROAD TO HOLLYWOOD: ""They say that art is where you find it, and René McMillen finds a lot of it in small town America. She makes the case that the art world extends far beyond the hubs of New York and Los Angeles, and highlights artists who are experts in their craft in the small communities they love. An inspiration for anyone blessed (cursed?) with artistic ability, René shows there are lots of appreciative audiences for an artist's work."" -Dave Lerner, retired TV anchor and newscaster, and writer ""Reading René McMillen's Abandoning the Road to Hollywood: How to Thrive as an Artist in Your Community, made me realize that although I haven't written a book that's landed on the bestseller list, I can still be proud of what I have written, and that my creativity is mine to own and not based on monetary success."" -Merissa Racine, stenographer by day and author of Silent Gavel ""Through the seamless retelling of life events, McMillen creates an immensely personal connection for artists of any medium on their path-to publication, recitation, performance, or gallery space. A self-confessed 'searching artist, ' McMillen's journey isn't built on gathering the most likes, followers, or comments. Rather, the Wyoming artist's vocation began simply with a belief that she was an artist. From that belief, she pioneered a path to bring creativity into her life and her rural West community. There are so many gems in Abandoning the Road to Hollywood: How to Thrive as an Artist in Your Community, you'll find yourself reaching for a highlighter, dog-earing a page of the book, or texting a quote to a fellow artisan."" -Mary Biliter, Art Education Specialist at Wyoming Arts Council by day and author of seventeen books"

9780521122801,"Tension has long existed in the social sciences between quantitative and qualitative approaches on one hand, and theory-minded and empirical techniques on the other. The latter divide has grown sharper in the wake of new behavioural and experimental perspectives which draw on both sides of these modelling schemes. This book works to address this disconnect by establishing a framework for methodological unification: empirical implications of theoretical models (EITM). This framework connects behavioural and applied statistical concepts, develops analogues of these concepts, and links and evaluates these analogues. The authors offer detailed explanations of how these concepts may be framed, to assist researchers interested in incorporating EITM into their own research. They go on to demonstrate how EITM may be put into practice for a range of disciplines within the social sciences, including voting, party identification, social interaction, learning, conflict and cooperation to macro-policy formulation."

9781087974439," 1. Khi tôi muốn nói, tôi nói. Khi tôi muốn nói một cách rõ ràng, đầy đủ và mạch lạc, tôi viết. Khi có ai đó nhoi nhói trong đầu đòi tôi phải nói những gì tôi không thể nói được, tôi làm thơ. Ai? Tôi chưa bao giờ gặp mặt hắn. Chỉ đôi lần thấy bóng hắn thấp thoáng lướt qua. Rất khẽ. Như một ý nghĩ dâm đãng loé lên rồi tắt ngúm lúc đi đường. Có lúc tôi nghe hắn thở dài lặng lẽ. Mỗi tiếng thở dài làm nhấp lên con chuột. Màn ảnh máy vi tính đầy chữ dần. Những chữ không biết đến từ đâu. Bài thơ nào tôi cũng đưa cho vợ tôi xem. Vợ tôi không nói gì. Chỉ nhìn tôi như kẻ lạ. Không bao giờ chúng tôi làm tình sau khi tôi làm thơ xong.   2. Với thơ, tôi nghĩ, hai câu thì hơi ít; bốn câu thì hơi thừa. Tôi chọn ở giữa: Ba câu. Xin đừng lầm thơ ba câu ở đây với thơ haiku. Haiku, xuất phát từ Nhật, là thể thơ cách luật với những quy định nghiêm ngặt về số âm tiết trong cả bài cũng như trong mỗi câu, và sau chúng, là một hệ mỹ học riêng, khá đặc thù. Trong thơ ba câu, một số bài có thể nằm gọn trong cái khung mỹ học của haiku, tuy nhiên, nhiều hơn, tự bản chất, là thơ tự do. Hoàn toàn tự do. Ngay cả khi nó có vẻ có vần, nó vẫn là thơ tự do. Nó chỉ giống haiku ở một điểm: Giới hạn trong ba dòng, với một số chữ hạn chế, bài thơ bị nén chặt, thật chặt, để, sau đó, bùng nổ trong lòng người đọc. Phần quan trọng nhất là phần ""bùng nổ"" ấy. Nó nằm ngoài câu chữ. Nó chỉ có thể được nghe thấy bằng sự nhạy cảm và sự đồng cảm. Nó thuộc về phần tương tác của người đọc. Dĩ nhiên, vẫn có trường hợp người đọc, dù nhiệt tình tương tác, vẫn không nghe tiếng ""nổ"" nào cả. Đó là sự thất bại của tác giả. Trong trường hợp đó, tác giả xin nhận lỗi. 3. Tất cả các bài thơ trong tập này được sáng tác trong năm 2020 và nửa đầu năm 2021.NGUYỄN HƯNG QUỐC"

But on sign-up day, a head-on collision between two trains nearly derails their plans. While Charlie is dreadfully injured, a man appears out of nowhere and saves Jacoba.  Friction between the newlyweds arises when Jacoba's name is drawn in the lottery instead of Charlie's. During the winter, as Charlie heals, Jacoba labors to make ends meet.

9781771714167,"Speaking in Tongues should come as a welcome surprise to English-language readers, as it not only opens new doors, but also presents exciting technical challenges. H.C. ten Berge is a master of many genres, but poetry informs all of his writing. In this generous new selection of poems and poem-sequences translated into English - his first publication in book form in North America - we follow the exciting trajectory of the poet from his initial collection,  Poolsneeuw (Polar Snow) in 1964, to his most recent,  In tongen spreken, which came out in 2020. His poetry is nourished and influenced not only by the contemporary world, but also by the European Middle Ages and earlier civilizations. A major voice in The Netherlands, Ten Berge has won many prizes and distinctions, including the prestigious P.C. Hooft Award (2006), the jury celebrating that he 'has opened Dutch poetry to worlds that until then had gone unnoticed.'"

9780520215955,"A human and global take on a beloved vacation spot.  The crash of surf, smell of salted air, wet whorls of sand underfoot. These are the sensations of the beach, that environment that has drawn humans to its life-sustaining shores for millennia. And while the gull's cry and the cove's splendor have remained constant throughout time, our relationship with the beach has been as fluid as the runnels left behind by the tide's turning.The Lure of the Beach is a chronicle of humanity's history with the coast, taking us from the seaside pleasure palaces of Roman elites and the aquatic rituals of medieval pilgrims, to the venues of modern resort towns and beyond. Robert C. Ritchie traces the contours of the material and social economies of the beach throughout time, covering changes in the social status of beach goers, the technology of transport, and the development of fashion (from nudity to Victorianism and back again), as well as the geographic spread of modern beach-going from England to France, across the Mediterranean, and from nineteenth-century America to the world. And as climate change and rising sea levels erode the familiar faces of our coasts, we are poised for a contemporary reckoning with our relationship--and responsibilities--to our beaches and their ecosystems. The Lure of the Beach demonstrates that whether as a commodified pastoral destination, a site of ecological resplendency, or a flashpoint between private ownership and public access, the history of the beach is a human one that deserves to be told now more than ever before."

9781725285323,"What is it that makes something beautiful? Is beauty solely in the eye of the beholder, or something deeper, more significant? In Beauty (and the Banana), Nixon writes as an introductory book for Christian leaders, providing the reader an overview of the historical, hermeneutical, and heuristic considerations of beauty. Using the artwork Comedian (a banana taped to a wall) by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan as a springboard, Nixon addresses various fundamental factors of beauty--ontology (being), teleology (form and understanding), and immutability (transcendence and eternality). Integrating poetry and classical ideals throughout, Beauty (and the Banana)'s response to the above questions may surprise all who read--beauty is more than meets the eye."

9781648891489,"In this monograph, Dr. Armstrong argues that a nation founded in Enlightenment theory can rely on Kant's categorical imperative as a rationale for voluntary service in one's local National Guard. Since the 19th century, a Utilitarian argument has been the favored rationale, but in We Hold These Truths to be Self-Evident: The National Guard and the Categorical Imperative Dr. Armstrong contends that there is also a normative rationale. The author traces Guard history from its inception in 1636 to the present day and applies Kant's unchanging categorical imperative to volunteer service in the militias. She highlights that this is an ideal that is not always met by frail human beings but that the categorical imperative is always there, lurking in the historical record. With a thorough analysis of Kant's reasoning, the theory is chronologically applied to volunteer service in the National Guard through the perspective of the leadership of each particular era. This book is ideal for the study of American history, Enlightenment philosophy, and political science. It will appeal to scholars and academics as well as officers in Professional Military Education (PME), service academies and War Colleges, and the National Defense University. "

This little reported battle had far reaching consequences for all involved. Here we become aware of how a handful of these ANZACs felt, what they saw and experienced in Greece, Crete and in numerous POW camps where some of them were interned. We realise how the small contacts they had with home through parcels and letters came to mean the world to them. We learn how they grieved for lost comrades. The forging of unbreakable bonds, particularly with the Cretan people who fought alongside them, often at great sacrifice to themselves, their families and friends. How 80 years later those bonds of friendship have been handed down from family to family. ""You have done your best to save us. We are finished, but the war is not lost. Therefore save what you can to help win the war elsewhere."" - Alexandros Koryzis, Prime Minister of Greece, "

9781773237916,"November 4, 1922. For six seasons the legendary Valley of the Kings has yielded no secrets to Howard Carter and his archeological team: ""We had almost made up our minds that we were beaten,"" he writes, ""and were preparing to leave The Valley and try our luck elsewhere; and then - hardly had we set hoe to ground in our last despairing effort than we made a discovery that far exceeded our wildest dreams.""Join Howard Carter in his fascinating odyssey toward the most dramatic archeological find of the century - the tomb of Tutankhamen. Written by Carter in 1923, only a year after the discovery, this book captures the overwhelming exhilaration of the find, the painstaking, step-by-step process of excavation, and the wonder of opening a treasure-filled inner chamber whose regal inhabitant had been dead for 3,000 years.104 on-the-spot photographs chronicle the phases of the discovery and the scrupulous cataloging of the treasures. The opening chapters discuss the life of Tutankhamen and earlier archeological work in the Valley of the Kings. An appendix contains fully captioned photographs of the objects obtained from the tomb. A new preface by Jon Manchip White adds information on Carter's career, recent opinions on Tutankhamen's reign, and the importance of Carter's discovery to Egyptologists.Millions have seen the stunning artifacts which came from the tomb - they are among the glories of the Cairo Museum, and have made triumphal tours to museums the world over. They are a testament to the enigmatic young king, and to the unwavering tenacity of the man who brought them to light as described in this remarkable narrative. "

9798585211041,"The Great Unspoken in Jewish-Christian dialogue is Jesus's conception. It's a topic avoided even by many who accept his resurrection. This book tackles the issue. Did Jesus exist before Bethlehem? Who was mysterious Melchizedek? What does Psalm 110 really say? How far do the variant genealogies of Matthew and Luke really make sense? Was Mary a peasant or a princess? And what are the options for Jesus's paternity? Just how Jewish was he really?Just as the author's Messiah ben Joseph examined the ancient origins of the sacrificial Messiah promised to Joseph, so Jesus: The Incarnation of the Word looks at the origins of the Zadokite Messiah.BACK COVER REVIEWSDavid Mitchell's Jesus: The Incarnation of the Word is a fascinating read. While its title seemingly rehearses well-trodden paths that need no further attention, that presumption could not be more misguided. The author is deeply conversant in the Hebrew Bible, Septuagint, Second Temple Jewish literature, Rabbinic writings, and early Christian and Patristic texts. All are brought into service to offer intriguing solutions to various difficulties arising from the Davidic (and priestly!) genealogies of Joseph and Mary and the relationship of Jesus to Melchizedek and the Angel of the Lord. Readers will find this a rewarding study. Michael S. Heiser, PhD (Hebrew Studies, Wisconsin)Bestselling author of The Unseen RealmExecutive Director and Professor, Awakening School of TheologyJesus: The Incarnation of the Word brings readers on an eye-opening journey through Old and New Testament texts, genealogies, and extra-biblical sources ancient and modern to probe the core question distinguishing Christianity from other faiths: is Jesus God in the flesh? With meticulous attention to detail, David C. Mitchell applies his exegetical acumen and extensive expertise in second temple and Rabbinic literature to uncover the remarkable breadth of the Bible's testimony about the Messiah and its long history of discussion. Erudite, witty, and eminently readable, this volume will enlighten, challenge, and inspire as it reveals how deep and wide are the Bible's messianic promises fulfilled in Jesus of Nazareth.

9781649570857,"Private Investigations Book One and TwoBy: Darryl C. VickersBook One: Private Investigations revolves around the world of Sam Aquino, an old fashioned Filipino private detective who relies on his wits, people skills, and if necessary a few tricks up his sleeve to solve some mysterious cases within his local Westlake community. But Sam isn't alone, he's got a diverse community of friends and family to help him because that's what people do.Westlake is a community loosely based on my experiences growing up in my diverse neighborhood in San Diego, Ca. during the 60's and 70's. Things were much different back then. People knew each other, and families weren't limited to blood relatives. There was a sense of community and good will towards everyone no matter what their gender, race, skin color or ability.In Book One, what starts out as Sam's frustration with a high tech surveillance firm operating nearby and a case involving the missing daughter of a client, who's a close long time friend of Sam's asst. ends up intersecting, forcing Sam to use his street smarts and personality skills to gain information to solve a human trafficking case. And that case directly involves members of his extended/blended family, which includes his personal assistant Donna, Sam's daughter in-law Christine as well as his college aged granddaughter Megan and her close friends who have detective skills of their own.Mystery, intrigue, suspense, and coincidences are all intertwined throughout this fast paced adventure featuring multi-generational and multi ethnic characters, who sometimes speak different languages, including many of the female characters who display smart and strong personalities.Book Two: Private Investigations is not only a story about Private Investigator Sam Aquino (an old fashioned Filipino private detective) who goes about investigating his cases within his local Westlake community, but a story about promoting goodwill and diversity that mirrors the world we now live in which consists of many people of diverse cultures, races, economic backgrounds and abilities.Readers will find the world of Private Investigations very different. It concentrates on those human connections. You'll find the characters in Private Investigations aren't too far from reality and not too much the reader can't relate to. Private Investigations celebrates all our differences yet shows how including all of these different traits makes us a very powerful community.All the main characters from Book One are back in Book Two, including Sam's granddaughter Megan, her three friends Jennifer, Samantha and Nicole, Christine (Megan's mother), Sam's assistant Donna Jones, Detectives Harrington and Chambers among others. Only this outing, we dig deeper into their personal lives and some of the issues they're dealing with on a daily basis, while also introducing new and potential family members. Readers will be introduced to a whole host of new characters either connected directly or indirectly to PI Sam Aquino, such as Tsunami Football Players, employees of the Nutrition Booster company and Memorial Hospital. District Attorney's and members of several law enforcement agencies are also prominently featured.This outing Sam is forced to circle the wagons per se and call for help when members of his own extended/blended family become exposed and targeted as he continues taking on more cases. Mystery, Intrigue, Suspense and Coincidences is still intertwined throughout Book Two which features many more multi-generational and multi ethnic characters speaking different languages and accents."

Drawing on sources in Spanish, Portuguese, French, Latin, and English, this monograph underscores the chaotically international, polyglot nature of early Appalachian history and foregrounds the region as a locus of imperial conflict during the early modern period. It likewise explores the European obsession with Appalachian mineral resources from 1528 to 1715, reframing Appalachian history within the fields of Latin American, early American, and Atlantic history. Ultimately, Appalachia as Contested Borderland of the Early Modern Atlantic provides new perspectives for scholars and students and suggests new directions for research in Native American and Indigenous studies, environmental studies, and Appalachian studies."

9781666718935,"In his teens, a young man wrote, """"I believe in no religion. There is absolutely no proof for any of them."""" After serving in the trenches of WW1, the same young man said, """"I never sank so low as to pray."""" To a religious friend, he wrote impatiently, """"You can't start with God. I don't accept God!"""" This young man was C. S. Lewis, the """"foul-mouthed atheist"""" who would become one of the most eloquent Christian writers of the twentieth century. David C. Downing offers a unique look at Lewis's personal journey to faith and the profound influence it had on his life as a writer and eventual follower of Christ. This is the first book to focus on the period from Lewis's childhood to his early thirties, a tumultuous journey of spiritual and intellectual exploration. It was not despite this journey but precisely because of it that Lewis understood the search for life's meaning so well."
9781439920701,"Few artists have ever been so beloved--or so controversial among art critics--as Andrew Wyeth. The groundbreaking book Artists of Wyeth Country presents an unauthorized and unbiased biographical portrait of Wyeth, based on interviews with family, friends, neighbors--even actress Eva Marie Saint. Journalist W. Barksdale Maynard shines new light on the reclusive artist, emphasizing Wyeth's artistic debt to Howard Pyle as well as his surprising interest in surrealism. The book is filled with brand-new information and fresh interpretations. Artists of Wyeth Country also comprises the first-ever guidebook to the artistic world of Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, center of the Brandywine Tradition begun by Howard Pyle. Six in-depth tours for walking or driving allow the reader to stand exactly where N. C. and Andrew Wyeth stood, as has never been fully possible before.  As Maynard explains, Andrew Wyeth's artistic process was influenced by Henry David Thoreau's nature-worship and by his habit of walking daily. Newly commissioned maps, rare aerial photographs, as well as glorious full-color images and artworks of the landscape (many never reproduced before) illustrate the text.  A fascinating exploration of the world of Andrew Wyeth,  Artists of Wyeth Country is sure to become an essential new source for those who love American art as well as for admirers of the scenic landscapes of the Mid-Atlantic, of which the Brandywine Valley is an exceptional example. As a rare, unauthorized biography of Andrew Wyeth, it opens the door for an entirely new understanding of the American master.   "

9781793614636,"In the early twentieth century, the Dadaists protested against art, nationalism, the individual subject, and technologized war. With their automatic anti-art and cultural disruptiveness, Dadaists sought to ""signify no thing."" Today, data also operates autonomously. However, rather than dismantling tradition, data organizes, selects, combines, quantifies, and simplifies the complexity of actuality. Like Dada, data also signifies nothing. While Dadaists protest with purpose, data proceeds without intention. The individual in the early twentieth century agonizes over the alienation from daily life and the fear of being converted into a cog in a machine. Today, however, the individual in twenty-first-century supermodernity merges, not with large industrial machinery, but with the processual and procedural logic of programming with innocuous ease. Both exclude human agency from self-narration but to differing degrees of abstraction. Examining the work of B.R. Yeager, Samuel Beckett, Jeff Noon, Kenji Siratori, Mike Bonsall, Allison Parrish, and narratives written by artificial intelligence, Wenaus considers the threshold of sensible narration and the effects that the shift from a culture of language to a culture of digital code has on lived experience. While data offers a closed system, Dadaist literature of exclusion, he suggests, promises a future of open, hyper-contingent, unprescribed alternatives for self-narration."

9781791013387,"Pastors and church leaders genuinely want to care for people in their congregations and communities. But pastors cannot care for an entire church, and most laypersons don't have the training to do it. The Caring Congregation Ministry is a model for person-to-person care that's been proven to work in small and large churches across the U.S. It is a laity-centered ministry, where laypersons receive rigorous training and then are commissioned to serve as Congregational Care Ministers, caring for others in their own congregation and their extended community. This remarkable approach to congregational care was first developed by author Karen Lampe and her team at The United Methodist Church of the Resurrection, in Kansas City. It has been tested, refined, and strengthened, and is now being adapted in all sorts of congregational settings. One early adapter was co-author Melissa Gepford, who launched a Caring Congregation Ministry in her own rural church. Together, they have created this immensely practical guide for any pastor or leader seeking to create a congregational care ministry. This Implementation Guide is the main book for getting started. It introduces the ministry model and explains the Five Essentials which form the ministry's foundation. It is extremely practical, full of checklists and other tools to help pastors and other leaders understand (and explain) this way of providing congregational care. The Implementation Guide also includes a section focused on the crucial component of this ministry-the Congregational Care Minister, or CCM. This section fully describes the characteristics of CCM's, how to recruit people to this ministry, how to discern if candidates are a good fit, and how to conduct the CCM training over a multi-week period. It details the critical information CCM's must know, and the behaviors and habits they must practice in order to be effective. Note that the companion book, The Caring Congregation Ministry: Care Minister's Manual, is required for the CCM training. It serves as a training workbook, which then becomes the CCM's personal reference manual."

It's the hottest Summer in fifty years and Joseph Severin, a respectable North London businessman, has taken on a lucrative side job. He's doing the books, old school, (because these days the only trail you can't trace is a paper one) for a rogue MI5 outfit, the Shadows, headed by clever, psychopathic Sebastien. When the game is rumbled, he sends their hitman, Mr Phipps, to kill Severin and get those books back.For a simple man, Severin has a complicated life. He's developed a sudden and wild passion for Lottie - aka 'chaos on two legs'. Who is in love with Patrick, the next hot young black actor. Who is obsessed by Sonya, a gorgeous Russian escort. Who has one night to make the final money she needs for her daughter's cancer operation.With MI6 onto them, and the books missing, the Shadows panic. And a day that begins with a hit in Finchley ends in violence and betrayal on the steamy night streets of Portobello.ONE LONDON DAY is a daisy chain tale of characters and connections, a contemporary London Noir. Like that genre's 40's origins, this story has its hood, its moll, its femme fatale, its fancy boy.

9781621903352,"Fourteen-year-old George Maguire was eager to serve the Union when his home state, Maryland, began raising regiments for the coming conflict. Too young to join, he became a ""mascot"" for the Fifth Maryland Infantry Regiment, organized in September 1861. Although he never formally enlisted or carried a weapon, Maguire recounts several pivotal events in the war, including the sea battle of the Monitor vs. Merrimac, Peninsula Campaign action, and the Battle of Antietam.During middle age, Maguire recorded his memoir--one of the few from a Maryland unit--providing a distinctive blend of the adventures of a teenage boy with the mature reflection of a man. His account of the Peninsula Campaign captures the success of the mobilization of forces and confirms the existing historical record, as well as illuminating the social structure of camp life. Maguire's duties evolved over time, as he worked alongside army surgeons and assisted his brother-in-law (a ""rabid abolitionist"" and provost marshal of the regiment). This experience qualified him to work at the newly constructed Thomas Hicks United States General Hospital once he left the regiment in 1863; his memoir describes the staffing hierarchy and the operating procedures implemented by the Army Medical Corps at the end of the war, illuminated with the author's own sketches of the facility.From the Pratt Street riot in Baltimore to a chance encounter with Red Cross founder Clara Barton to a firsthand view of Hicks Hospital, this sweeping yet brief memoir provides a unique opportunity to examine the experiences of a child during the war and to explore the nuances of memory. Beyond simply retelling the events as they happened, Maguire's memoir is woven with a sense of remorse and resolve, loss and fear, and the pure wonderment of a teenage boy accompanying one of the largest assembled armies of its day."

9780268200602,"Faith, Nationalism, and the Future of Liberal Democracy highlights the use of religious identity to fuel the rise of illiberal, nationalist, and populist democracy.In Faith, Nationalism, and the Future of Liberal Democracy, David Elcott, C. Colt Anderson, Tobias Cremer, and Volker Haarmann present a pragmatic and modernist exploration of how religion engages in the public square. Elcott and his co-authors are concerned about the ways religious identity is being used to foster the exclusion of individuals and communities from citizenship, political representation, and a role in determining public policy. They examine the ways religious identity is weaponized to fuel populist revolts against a political, social, and economic order that values democracy in a global and strikingly diverse world. Included is a history and political analysis of religion, politics, and policies in Europe and the United States that foster this illiberal rebellion.The authors explore what constitutes a constructive religious voice in the political arena, even in nurturing patriotism and democracy, and what undermines and threatens liberal democracies. To lay the groundwork for a religious response, the book offers chapters showing how Catholicism, Protestantism, and Judaism can nourish liberal democracy. The authors encourage people of faith to promote foundational support for the institutions and values of the democratic enterprise from within their own religious traditions and to stand against the hostility and cruelty that historically have resulted when religious zealotry and state power combine.Faith, Nationalism, and the Future of Liberal Democracy is intended for readers who value democracy and are concerned about growing threats to it, and especially for people of faith and religious leaders, as well as for scholars of political science, religion, and democracy."

9781953682024,"Prophecy foretells: the gods will select a man of reformation and a woman of healing to save our golden empire from a being of devastation. Tainted by the mortal blood of another, only mortal hands shall defeat.Seville and Lorenzo Diaz were once close brothers who scrambled together before bed to listen to their parents regale them with the timeless tale of the City of Gold. A story of gods, enchantment, and a golden barter.However, as the years lead on, and their parents passed, the once bonded brothers attempted to keep their bond strong. They gambled together, drank together, and yet even then, it wasn't good enough. Lorenzo had other ways to make his earnings and Seville went off to have a family, where he continued to shake the dice and repeatedly lost. Seville was the only Diaz brother to keep the legend of the City of Gold alive as he tucked his young daughter into bed.Lorenzo, on the other hand, ventured off to guarantee his own luck.Loredana Moretti, the daughter of Alessio Moretti, a great apothecary in Rome, Italy, closed the doors of her father's legacy along with his hopes and dreams for her. His sudden passing left Loredana to walk in a shadow, defying the expectations set before her of marriage and to be cared for. She wanted more for herself, seeking greater escapism than the Frangelico she indulged in.One rowdy night at the pub, with an excited cluster of sailors cornered with a pair of dice, Loredana sees this as the sign she'd been looking for. Betting the last of her father's earnings, as well as her fate, Loredana feels a pull in the direction of the handsome captain, who bears a map of the City of Gold. Only the shake of the dice will determine what route she'll take.----Secrets of the City of Gold is an adventure novel set in 1512, taking you through the Golden Age of Spain, the trials of Italy, and coasts you through a plethora of cultures as you embark on this great escape to crack myth from reality.If you enjoy adventure novels, with a romantic affair or two, tokens of history (that do not read like a textbook), an entire golden empire with the magic of the gods, then you'll love this first installment from C.M.

Upon introduction to Seville as he lulls his daughter to sleep with the age old story, curiosity of what may come strikes as the struggle begins to put the book down. The depth of the characters and development they each go through offers a sense of relatability as the reader becomes more invested in their journey.

9781498577922,"The book examines contemporary immigration policy and immigrant assimilation with a focus on the adoption of sanctuary ordinances in US local governments in connection with Latino in-migration. It also investigates the adoption of anti-immigrant settlement local ordinances in many local governments with particular focus on local law enforcement positions taken on enforcement of federal immigration laws. The book investigates a wide range of county-level characteristics of 3,000+ U.S. counties (e.g., socio-economic and demographic traits, political culture, social capital, religious denominations present, etc.) to identify correlates of pro- and anti-immigrant settlement. The book also features the analysis of a national survey and three targeted surveys in pro-immigration (San Francisco), divided (Maricopa), and anti-immigration (Tulsa) counties to explore the individual-level factors associated with sentiments on immigration policy. Finally, the book presents findings from two case studies where active encouragement of Latino settlement (Twin Falls, ID) and active opposition (Hazleton, PA) characterize local reaction to Latino in-migration. The mixed methods study leads the authors to conclude that a funnel of causality concept, path dependency, pro-social attitudes, and the concepts of moral panic and moral dialogue collectively lead to great insight into the question of why some communities are open and accepting while others are exclusionary."

From a hybrid approach appealing to Gender Studies, Feminist and Post-Feminist Studies, Cultural Studies, Subaltern Studies, Memory and Post-memory studies, we propose three axes of analysis through Rocío's Silva Santisteban poetic and narrative works: The patriarchal system and gender inequality, sexual violence against women during the internal armed conflict and post-memory. It is an approach that attends to the analysis of the articulations between different systems of signs and discursive practices, literary or not."

9781664224032,"Spirituality is a process and not a quick fix. For example, to succeed in your chosen profession, you must study and hone certain skills. Many pursue a career only to give up because they lack the discipline to get to their destination. Likewise, you must have discipline to walk with the Lord and receive His gifts. In this book, the author shares her spiritual experiences so you can:  - establish a spiritual link with Almighty God; - put the Lord above all others; - eliminate doubts about the existence of God; - grow your faith in the absence of financial and moral support. The author also reveals how praying, fasting, and meditating made a huge difference in her life. She emphasizes that instead of going through life loving money, we should love God. The Holy Spirit is available as long as you accept it and give honor to the Lord by obeying His instructions. Deliver yourself from evil and grow strong in your faith with the wisdom in this book."

9781649907479,"When we hear of Jamaica or the Caribbean, we think of beautiful islands of paradise with sun, sea and sand, reggae music, cannabis, and ""irie"" people like Usain Bolt- people who are living out their best dreams, desires, and lives. But this book analyzes this motif, given the historical and current economic and political situation in Jamaica and the Caribbean and the ""Global South."" In an attempt to escape the adverse realities of poverty, inequality, and injustice, the people of the Global South find themselves in north metropolises with very little agency and minimal change to their lives. In fact, except for the use of cleaning neoliberal waste, the immigrant is usually portrayed as an alien with three heads and big sharp teeth seeking to steal and destroy the profit and disrupt society. As such we will discuss Black, brown, and Pan-African struggles for economic prosperity, justice, and freedom and consider efforts, abilities, or inabilities to chart their own futures since decolonization and realize real political independence and economic prosperity. Perhaps, they are charting their own course by the few corrupt of the status quo who are benefiting from partnerships with the neoliberal regime of the ""Washington Consensus,"" advocates of the ""bureaucratic phenomenon,"" while the masses are left behind. John Williamson, the inventor of the term ""Washington Consensus,"" believes the term has two quite different meanings. First is the meaning he gave the term, which involved consensus around a set of ten policy reforms, which he believed were widely accepted as beneficial by economists.The approach will be interdisciplinary and comprehensive, drawing on various disciplines and experiences and going beyond Jamaica to consider the wider Caribbean and the diaspora in the United States. It draws on past and present works on the subject and relies on readers' abilities, knowledge (primary or secondary), and skills to challenge, critically analyze, and develop their own thinking within a Jamaican, Caribbean, its diaspora, and/or American context given this century's challenges and opportunities. This Book is divided into two parts. Part A will examine whether Jamaica's inequality trends from the mid-1970s up to the beginning of the twenty-first century were a consequence of the structural adjustment policies stipulated by the neoliberal technocrats of the Washington Consensus in Jamaica. The study does not only concern itself with Jamaica, but Jamaica provides a case and a context within which to engage the subject matter. ﻿Part B will argue, given Jamaica's experience with neoliberal restructuring, that Jamaica-like many former colonies-is far from independent. Further, we will consider the response to the processes of decolonization and globalization that have deepened the realities of the peoples of the Global South and the peoples in the diaspora. There have been hundreds of protests against the Washington Consensus and their lackeys since 1976 by the global justice movement and recently the Black Lives Matter movement in America. Street protests and some degree of violence have been the main strategies of the group until recently. But are the resistance movements closer to achieving their aims? The effectiveness of the resistance will be determined by the extent to which they have realized actual power: ""demonstrated change in the desired direction."""

9781787633353,"'Wonderfully dark, extremely funny' proclaimed ADAM KAY, author of the No.1 bestselling This is Going to Hurt'A filmic romp with great characters, a jet-propelled plot, and a winning premise' said the GUARDIANJASON MANFORD thinks it's 'Hilarious. You'll never look at Manchester the same way again.'The Chronicles of St Mary's series author JODI TAYLOR declared 'I loved this . . . great premise - great story - great characters . . . hugely enjoyable.'And THE TIMES called it 'ripping entertainment from start to finish.' There are dark forces at work in our world (and in Manchester in particular), so thank God The Stranger Times is on hand to report them . . .  A weekly newspaper dedicated to the weird and the wonderful (but mostly the weird), it is the go-to publication for the unexplained and inexplicable. At least that's their pitch. The reality is rather less auspicious. Their editor is a drunken, foul-tempered and foul-mouthed husk of a man who thinks little of the publication he edits. His staff are a ragtag group of misfits. And as for the assistant editor . . . well, that job is a revolving door - and it has just revolved to reveal Hannah Willis, who's got problems of her own. When tragedy strikes in her first week on the job The Stranger Times is forced to do some serious investigating. What they discover leads to a shocking realisation: some of the stories they'd previously dismissed as nonsense are in fact terrifyingly real. Soon they come face-to-face with darker forces than they could ever have imagined.  The Stranger Times is the first novel from C.K. McDonnell, the pen name of Caimh McDonnell. It combines his distinctive dark wit with his love of the weird and wonderful to deliver a joyous celebration of how truth really can be stranger than fiction.Readers love The Stranger Times ***** 'A delight from start to finish - laugh out loud funny yet with plenty of thrills.'***** 'Full of wit and humour, and knows how to keep the reader hooked.'***** 'You'll soon fall in love . . . fans of Pratchett, Gaiman, Aaronovich will be blown away.'"

9781977240132,"Growing up, in South Central Virginia, a young Earl Johnson often failed to understand the real meaning of the word - success. The fact that some people were considered successful did not motivate or inspire him to maximize his potential. ""In reality, I failed to reflect on what real success was,"" he would later say. When a seventh-grade teacher asked the class to write a paper on what they wanted to do in life, Earl had no clue. He was dumbfounded, because he did not have the faintest idea of what he wanted to do in life. Looking back more than 40 years later, he realized that he had a parochial outlook on life. For a sustained period in his life, he was apprehensive with a morbid fear of failure. He suffered from success anxiety and was indecisive regarding career choices. He considered himself the victim of what noted psychologist Abraham Maslow called the ""Jonah Complex,"" in reference about the biblical prophet Jonah. He was chosen by God to execute a life-changing assignment of redemption and salvation to a city that had lost its way. Instead doing what God commanded, Jonah attempted to run away from his obligation. Hence, the Jonah complex, in many respects, is the fear of greatness and failure. It is the fear of what might happen if a person attempts to reach their highest possibilities. Earl believes that it is regrettable and a form of socio-spiritual suicide to have the ability to achieve god-like potential in life and fail to use that ability. This book is an invaluable and insightful tool for those searching to break the cycle of success anxiety, the fear of self-achievement, and the stripping away of self-imposed limitations. It helps you rediscover the keys to mental happiness. Using Christian themes, action research, relevant scriptures and examples from his childhood, Earl offers a clear and concise perspective in overcoming success anxiety and the fear of failure."

9798593300522,"A magical weapon in the hands of evil. It could end them all. Aboard the Dreadnaught, Shiphead Junathan Reed and the Raiders fight the battles that the Northlands can't. Peace is fleeting and sharp iron is the only ally. When a great Northlands vault is breached and a magical weapon plundered, Jun and the Raiders will head to the Southlands to take it back. The corsair responsible - Raynar Bloom the Halfsight - should be dead, but after coming out of hiding, he has barricaded himself on the Isle of Rats and conjured a deadly storm to deter any interlopers. With the ancient weapon in the Halfsight's grip, the realm is in danger that no fleet or army could withstand. But Jun has met with the Halfsight before, when everything he loved was torn from his heart and scattered to the seas. Once again, Jun will have to face the monster responsible for ten years of torment - the death of his family, the pain of his capture and the empty void of his life.  He'll stop at nothing to get his reckoning and bury the Halfsight. Even if he has to share the grave. 'Raiders' is the first book in a series called 'The Dying Light Saga'."

Winifred is a feisty, independent-minded heiress who bridles against the strict rules and conventions of Victorian London society. When she gets caught up in the chaos of a bungled bank robbery, she is thrust unwillingly into an encounter with Court Furor, a reluctant getaway driver and prizefighter. Winifred and Court are two misfits in their own circumscribed worlds-the fashionable beau monde with its rigorously upheld rules, and the gritty demimonde, where survival often means life-or-death choices.Despite their conflicting backgrounds, they fall desperately in love while acknowledging the impossibility of remaining together. Returning to their own worlds, they try to make peace with their lives until a moment of unrestrained honesty and defiance threatens to topple the deceptions they have carefully constructed to protect each other.A story of the overlapping entanglements of Victorian London's social classes, the strength of family bonds and true friendship, and the power of love to heal a broken spirit."

The two I could find there were pathetic (and if you think this one is another, perhaps you should be writing your own -- jump right in, the water's fine...)So I went out on the Internet and assembled all the research I could to see what and how this subject worked, if it did or not.Then I compared what I'd learned with what I already knew - and wrote it up for you so you could use it.After that, I spent three years mastering the craft and fine-tuning the publishing methods.

As you apply yourself, as you push your own envelope, then you improve and find more areas to expand into.Just to be transparent, my work has been in non-fiction (mostly.)

However, the authors of ""Virus Mania,"" investigative journalist Torsten Engelbrecht, Dr. Claus Köhnlein, MD, Dr. Samantha Bailey, MD, and Dr. Stefano Scoglio, BSc PhD, show that this fearmongering is unfounded and that virus mayhem ignores basic scientific facts: The existence, the pathogenicity and the deadly effects of these agents have never been proven. The book ""Virus Mania"" will also outline how modern medicine uses dubious indirect lab tools claiming to prove the existence of viruses such as antibody tests and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The alleged viruses may be, in fact, also be seen as particles produced by the cells themselves as a consequence of certain stress factors such as drugs. These particles are then ""picked up"" by antibody and PCR tests and mistakenly interpreted as epidemic-causing viruses. The authors analyze all real causes of the illnesses named COVID-19, avian flu, AIDS or Spanish flu, among them pharmaceuticals, lifestyle drugs, pesticides, heavy metals, pollution, malnutrition and stress.

9781098086688,"Love Letters of a Believer is a book from the heart of a surrendered believer. As I struggled with unforgiveness, disappointment, depression, frustration, suicidal thoughts, financial debt, and dyslexia, I began to seek and desire an everlasting relationship with God. After experiencing the power of God's healing through faith and his love for me, I trusted and believed in his Word. I knew that if he healed me in one area, he would heal me in other areas where I needed deliverance, such as wounds of dealing with everyday life-the unhappiness, the brokenness, the regrets. I needed to learn how to pray through my pain, not from my pain and struggles.During my daily prayer time, I began to write letters to God. I shared everything in my heart, the good and bad. As I poured out my flesh on paper, my life as I had known it was beginning to transform. I was being delivered from my old ways the more I revealed myself to God in prayer.Over time, I have given birth to letters that became my love letters of prayer. As I share them with you, I pray that you find inner strength to share your whole heart with God. I pray that they will encourage you to seek a relationship with the father and to know that he will not fail you nor forsake you (Deuteronomy 31:6). You are not alone! If you are reading this book, there is still life to pursue purpose!"
9781098072612,"This book is about Faith, a woman who had children when she was young and unmarried. Because of where and when she was born, young unmarried women with children were often ostracized and their chances of achieving a high school education, not to mention, college education were very slim. While a woman in her situation only hope was marrying a man, who would take care of her and her children, she took a different approach. Steadily and with a determined mind, she cultivated her independence, inch by inch towards her passion for learning. She believed a good education would give her the leverage to shield herself from marriage as her only option to living. Against all odds and hardships that she experienced from early teenage years to young adulthood, she ultimately migrated from Liberia to the United States, went to school, and eventually earned advanced degrees. Her education dramatically improved her quality of life and boosted her self-confidence and self-worth. Faith is a model for young single mothers and fathers, who are often overlooked and denigrated by society, simply because they had children out of wedlock. With determination and strong faith in God, while pursuing aims and aspirations, their dreams can also become realities."

Gordon Stewart, Medizinprofessor und Ex-WHO-Berater - - - Mit Schreckensmeldungen über COVID-19, Masern, Schweinegrippe, SARS, BSE, AIDS oder Polio wird die Welt in Angst und Schrecken versetzt. Doch die Existenz und krankmachende oder gar tödliche Wirkung der angeblich dahinter stehenden Erreger wurden nie wirklich nachgewiesen. Dass das Gegenteil behauptet wird, liegt daran, dass die moderne Medizin seit geraumer Zeit mit indirekten ""Nachweis""verfahren (u.a. Antikörper- und PCR-Tests) hantiert. Doch wie die Autoren von ""Virus-Wahn"", der Journalist Torsten Engelbrecht, der Kieler Internist Dr. med. Claus Köhnlein, die neuseeländische Forschungsärztin Dr. med. Samantha Bailey und der Experte für Mikrobiologie Dr. Stefano Scoglio aufzeigen, taugen diese indirekten Methoden gar nicht zum Virusnachweis. Zudem spricht Vieles dafür, dass es sich bei den Partikeln, die von den orthodoxen Forschern als von au en attackierende Viren behauptet werden, um Teilchen handelt, die von den Zellen selber produziert werden (zum Beispiel als Folge von Stresseinflüssen wie Drogenkonsum). Diese Teilchen werden dann etwa von den PCR-Tests aufgelesen und von den Medizinern als ""böse Viren"" fehlinterpretiert, was Medien wie die ""New York Times"" und der ""Spiegel"" (auf die in ""Virus-Wahn"" näher eingegangen wird) in ihrer Berichterstattung tragischerweise nicht korrigieren.

9781108823203,"International investment law and arbitration is a rapidly evolving field, and can be difficult for students to acquire a firm understanding of, given the considerable number of published awards and legal writings. The first edition of this text, cited by courts in Singapore and Colombia, overcame this challenge by interweaving extracts from these arbitral decisions, treaties and scholarly works with concise, up-to-date and reliable commentary. Now fully updated and with a new chapter on arbitrators, the second edition retains this practical structure along with the carefully curated end-of-chapter questions and readings. The authors consider the new chapter an essential revision to the text, and a discussion which is indispensable to understanding the present calls for reform of investment arbitration. The coverage of the book has also been expanded, with the inclusion of over sixty new awards and judicial decisions, comprising both recent and well-established jurisprudence. This textbook will appeal to graduates studying international investment law and international arbitration, as well as being of interest to practitioners in this area."

Gilbert the spider along with Judas Robinson's worlds will become paralleled in this story about redemption and faith.

The answer lies in the concerted action of molecular components which cooperate through a series of carefully regulated processes to bring the information in our genome to life. These components and processes lie at the heart of one of the most fascinating subjects to engage the minds of scientiststoday: molecular biology. Molecular Biology: Principles of Genome Function offers a fresh, distinctive approach to the teaching of molecular biology. It is an approach that reflects the challenge of teaching a subject that is in many ways unrecognizable from the molecular biology of the 20th century--a discipline in whichour understanding has advanced immeasurably, but about which many questions remain to be answered. It is written with several guiding themes in mind: - A focus on key principles provides a robust conceptual framework on which students can build a solid understanding of the discipline;- An emphasis on the commonalities that exist between the three kingdoms of life, and the discussion of differences between the three kingdoms where such differences offer instructive insights into molecular processes and components, gives students an accurate depiction of our current understandingof the conserved nature of molecular biology, and the differences that underpin biological diversity;- An integrated approach demonstrates how certain molecular phenomena have diverse impacts on genome function by presenting them as themes that recur throughout the book, rather than as artificially separated topics At heart, molecular biology is an experimental science, and a central element to the understanding of molecular biology is an appreciation of the approaches taken to yield the information from which concepts and principles are deduced. Yet there is also the challenge of introducing the experimentalevidence in a way that students can readily comprehend. Molecular Biology responds to this challenge with Experimental Approach panels, which branch off from the text in a clearly-signposted way. These panels describe pieces of research that have been undertaken, and which have been particularly valuable in elucidating different aspects of molecularbiology. Each panel is carefully cross-referenced to the discussion of key molecular biology tools and techniques, which are presented in a dedicated chapter at the end of the book. Beyond this, Molecular Biology further enriches the learning experience with full-colour, custom-drawn artwork; end-of-chapter questions and summaries; relevant suggested further readings grouped by topic; and an extensive glossary of key terms. Among the students being taught today are the molecular biologists of tomorrow; these individuals will be in a position to ask fascinating questions about fields whose complexity and sophistication become more apparent with each year that passes. Molecular Biology: Principles of Genome Function isthe perfect introduction to this challenging, dynamic, but ultimately fascinating discipline."

9783110728477,"The Syrian Social Nationalist Party devoted itself to reviving and unifying the Syrian nation and establishing this nation's complete independence over its historical homeland, Greater Syria. It continues its struggle today, influencing and shaping Lebanese and Syrian society and politics. Yet, the party remains largely unknown and misunderstood, a condition that stems from the lack of any comprehensive study of it. This book fills this gap.  Syrian nationalism and nationalist movements, generally speaking, have been largely neglected and ignored by historians, scholars, and observers of the Middle East. So, too, has the SSNP. The lack of detailed and nuanced analyses has left significant gaps in the party's rich history unaddressed and enabled the perpetuation of inaccuracies and misperceptions regarding its past. Given this and the party's ongoing relevance in Lebanon and Syria, a thorough examination of the early history of the SSNP, the political organization and movement that embodied Syrian nationalism's most explicit, most cogent expression is even more necessary.  Based on an extensive and thorough examination of Arabic, French, and English primary sources, the monograph is the first comprehensive, systematic history of the SSNP to date, detailing its struggle to fulfill its nationalist vision and establish a secular, independent state in Greater Syria through a thorough analysis of its formation, evolution, and political activities in Lebanon and Syria.

The younger of the two, 8 year old George, went on a hunger strike; he refused to eat. Forester made up the stories to tell during dinnertime, but would only tell them if George would eat. If George stopped eating, Forester stopped talking mid-sentence. By the time Kathleeen returned home and everything returned to normal, there were a number of Poo-Poo stories, and 3 dragons. Forester collected the stories in manuscript form and Little Brown published it."
9781977240934,"Carl was trained as a gunner and radio operator on a B-24 stationed in Norfolk England. He Flew 26 missions including the raid on Ploesti Oil Refineries in Romania from a South African base near Benghazi. In his letters to ""home folks"" he describes the places and people he sees through the eyes of a photographer from both air and land, and shares observations of the people he meets. His Diary describes the daily life of a soldier and the dangers, ""excitement,"" successes and failures of the bombing missions the crew of the ship, ""Lemon Drop"" are a part of. Through his letters and diary, Carl reveals his thoughts, passions, love of family, love of wife, love of living, and window into his soul. As he writes home, Carl often mentions his youngest nephew by inserting a, ""Tell Johnny Hello."" Johnny is the author and was only three at the time. John's personal observations and interpretations describe a two-year history of the Cleland Family. It is a WWII Gold Star story as told by a soldier caught up in the drama and sacrifices of war. The author has no memory of his Uncle Carl but came into possession of Carl's footlocker containing 125 letters, scrap books, mementos, a few photos, a box of his medals, including two Air Medals with five Oak Leaf Clusters, a Distinguished Flying Cross, and a leather bound diary. As the letters and diary were transcribed and collated the story emerges and Johnny gets to know his Uncle Carl intimately through Carl's written word. The story includes a wartime love story. Carl and Nellie were married just before he left for England and do not see each other for ten months. He returns home and after a long leave with Nellie and family, Carl is assigned to a training facility for heavy bombers in Casper Wyoming. The tragic end of the story comes in a headline from a local newspaper, War Hero Killed in Wyoming Plane Crash"

9781725289239,"Baptists in the nineteenth century grew from a small, struggling denomination to the second-largest Protestant denomination in America. They constructed conventions, schools, churches, and benevolent works. American Baptists transformed from cultural outsiders to insiders. Despite this growth in size, organization, and influence, there is surprisingly few attempts to understand them historically. This is even more true for Northern Baptists as opposed to their Southern counterparts, despite the fact that Northern Baptists, in many respects, were the theological leaders of the denomination. This raises questions about what their theology was, what it was rooted in, and how well it could handle the surplus of challenges that nineteenth-century religion threw at it. Chief among these were the challenges toward biblical and theological authority. Perhaps the brightest star of the Northern Baptist constellation, and doubtless the most well-connected, was Alvah Hovey from Newton Theological Institute in Newton Centre, Massachusetts. This book, the first book-length treatment of this Baptist giant since Hovey's son published a biography in 1929, chronicles Hovey's life and career focusing on how he coped with the challenges of biblical criticism and a rapidly changing theological context. Hovey produced a theology he understood as thoughtful Christianity."
9798738711046,"Train up a child in the way he should go; and when he is old, he will not depart from it."" I suppose that most professing Christians are acquainted with the text at the head of this page. The sound of it is probably familiar to your ears, like an old tune. It is likely you have heard it, or read it, talked of it, or quoted it, many a time. Is it not so But, after all, how little is the substance of this text regarded! The doctrine it contains appears scarcely known, the duty it puts before us seems fear-fully seldom practised. Reader, do I not speak the truth? It cannot be said that the subject is a new one. The world is old, and we have the experience of nearly six thousand years to help us. We live in days when there is a mighty zeal for education in every quarter. We hear of new schools rising on all sides. We are told of new systems, and new books for the young, of every sort and description. And still for all this, the vast majority of children are manifestly not trained in the way they should go, for when they grow up to man's estate, they do not walk with God. Now how shall we account for this state of things The plain truth is, the Lord's commandment in our text is not regarded; and therefore the Lord's promise in our text is not fulfilled.Come now, and let me place before you a few hints about right training. God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost bless them, and make them words in season to you all. Reject them not because they are blunt and simple; despise them not because they contain nothing new. Be very sure, if you would train children for heaven, they are hints that ought not to be lightly set aside."

Although traumatized and addicted to a powerful drug, Ben refuses to doom anyone he cares about. Can he find a third option? Can he free Rachel and strike back at the dictatorship, while dodging the suspicions of police and rebels alike?"

9781949586169,"Lewis was an amazing author who has impacted the faith of millions of people around the world. Unfortunately, most people never read anything by C.S. Lewis other than The Chronicles of Narnia. This is good as far as it goes, but what a shame if that's all one ever reads of this genius. Although some may go on to read Mere Christianity or even The Screwtape Letters, Miracles or The Problem of Pain, very few have ever mined the riches that are to be found in Lewis's collected essays or had their longing for the numinous stirred by hauntingly brilliant Dymer and The Pilgrim's Regress. It is my desire in this book to show that Lewis is more than just Narnia. Beyond Narnia: The Theology of C.S. Lewis is an in-depth analysis of the most important themes in the work of C.S. Lewis, including the sensation of joy or longing as signposts to God, his view of the Bible as both myth and the Word of God, his defense of miracles against Hume's famous critique, his insightful observations on the problem of pain and his often misunderstood but groundbreaking thoughts on hell. This book provides an accessible and thorough introduction to C.S. Lewis for undergraduate students and Lewis fans who want to go deeper in their understanding."

The poems move into the contemporary Black diaspora, probing the mythologies of home, belief, nation, and womanhood.

The Woman in Black is actually the first novel in which gentleman sleuth Philip Trent appears. The novel is a whodunit with a place in detective fiction history because it is the first major sendup of that genre: Not only does Trent fall in love with one of the primary suspects-usually considered a no-no-he also, after painstakingly collecting all the evidence, draws all the wrong conclusions.Convinced that he has tracked down the murderer of a business tycoon who was shot in his mansion, he is told by the real perpetrator over dinner what mistakes in logical deduction he has made in trying to solve the case. On hearing what really happened, Trent vows that he will never again attempt to dabble in crime detection."

The barriers that once were in place since before the birth of humanity have been broken.There have been other protectors over time, but the battles they faced were elementary compared to what is to come. In the past, Earth's protectors policed the borders, making sure all sides maintained the laws set forth by God and enforcing those laws by any means necessary. Each person starting out with a normal, every day life and making their way through society, but that normal life is shattered by a sudden understanding and sometimes genetic responsibility.

9781665521949,"The purpose of this book is to show the simplicity of a complex God. There is a danger of not seeing what we're reading because our presumptions have sometimes blinded us, and we don't have inspiration on the Revelation. It is my hope that this book will be a light unto many pathways. God's word is meant to come alive in the hearts of men. It is my hope that this book will stir up your pure minds and people learn to be careful HOW they hear and avoid any type of perverted gospel that only causes an ""emotional high,"" to the neglect of food for the soul. This book will definitely make you think, because it will challenge what you've heard and cause you to read in depth as the teaching comes alive. I am eternally grateful that my wife Pamela, before her passing in January 2017, inspired me to get the words out of my head and encouraged me to write this book. Will it cause you to scratch your heads? Probably. . ."

Their ancestral home was a massive feudal castle on an eminence near the stately city of Leon. The armorial bearing of the family commemorates deeds of heroic enterprise five hundred years ago. They were generally earnest Christians.James Marquette was born at the ancient seat of the family in the year 1637. His mother was a woman of fervent piety and of unusual strength and culture of mind. Her brother, John Baptiste de la Salle, was the founder of a system of Christian schools for the gratuitous education of the poor.

9798725339017,"Book Excerpt: hat if they did not give city dances the place of prominence it was through choice, not ignorance.Among the ladies was one whom Burton knew to be the guest of honour, even before he was told; a young woman his own age, or older, dressed in a creamy white, with a single real rose in her hair. Her dark, full eye-lashes, the finely shaped nose and ears, the firm but sympathetic mouth, electrically responsive to every wave of emotion of her alert brain, were not lost upon the country youth. There were many graceful dancers, many radiant, happy-faced girls, but hers was a grace distinct from theirs and a happiness more subtle, more delightful, more pervading. The little tricks of speech which distinguish between the intelligent and the well-educated; the little delicate courtesies which distinguish between the well-meaning and the well-bred; the inborn and self-effacing refinement which is the touchstone of true culture--these were evidenced in every word, every motion, every gesture.

9780593102664,"Sebastian St. Cyr thought a notorious killer had been brought to justice until a shocking series of gruesome new murders stuns the city in this thrilling historical mystery from the USA Today bestselling author of Who Speaks for the Damned.  It's October 1814. The war with France is finally over and Europe's diplomats are convening in Vienna for a conference that will put their world back together. With peace finally at hand, London suddenly finds itself in the grip of a series of heinous murders eerily similar to the Ratcliffe Highway murders of three years before.  In 1811, two entire families were viciously murdered in their homes. A suspect--a young seaman named John Williams--was arrested. But before he could be brought to trial, Williams hanged himself in his cell. The murders ceased, and London slowly began to breathe easier. But when the lead investigator, Sir Edwin Pym, is killed in the same brutal way three years later and others possibly connected to the original case meet violent ends, the city is paralyzed with terror once more.  Was the wrong man arrested for the murders? Bow Street magistrate Sir Henry Lovejoy turns to his friend Sebastian St. Cyr, Viscount Devlin, for assistance. Pym's colleagues are convinced his manner of death is a coincidence, but Sebastian has his doubts. The more he looks into the three-year-old murders, the more certain he becomes that the hapless John Williams was not the real killer. Which begs the question--who was and why are they dead set on killing again?"

9780813180649,"On October 20, 1923, at Belmont Park in New York, Kentucky Derby champion Zev toed the starting line alongside Epsom Derby winner Papyrus, the top colt from England, to compete for a $100,000 purse. Years of Progressive reform efforts had nearly eliminated horse racing in the United States only a decade earlier. But for weeks leading up to the match race that would be officially dubbed the ""International,"" unprecedented levels of newspaper coverage helped accelerate American horse racing's return from the brink of extinction.   In this book, James C. Nicholson explores the convergent professional lives of the major players involved in the Horse Race of the Century, including Zev's oil-tycoon owner Harry Sinclair, and exposes the central role of politics, money, and ballyhoo in the Jazz Age resurgence of the sport of kings. Zev was an apt national mascot in an era marked by a humming industrial economy, great coziness between government and business interests, and reliance on national mythology as a bulwark against what seemed to be rapid social, cultural, and economic changes. Reflecting some of the contradiction and incongruity of the Roaring Twenties, Americans rallied around the horse that was, in the words of his owner, ""racing for America,"" even as that owner was reported to have been engaged in a scheme to defraud the United States of millions of barrels of publicly owned oil. Racing for America provides a parabolic account of a nation struggling to reconcile its traditional values with the complexity of a new era in which the US had become a global superpower trending toward oligarchy, and the world's greatest consumer of commercialized spectacle."

9798724886840,"Book Excerpt: match-legged phalaropes, and geese and ducks of every hue, collected for the autumnal flight south. It was a yellowish sea under a sky blue as turquoise; and it may be that Hudson recalled sailor yarns of China's seas, lying yellow under skies blue as a robin's egg. At any rate he continued to steer south in spite of the old mate's mutterings. Men in unwilling service at a few shillings a month do not court death for the sake of glory. The shore line of rocks and pine turned westward. So did Hudson, sounding the ship's line as he crept forward one sail up, the others rattling against the bare masts in the autumn wind--doleful music to the thoughts of the coward crew. The shore line at the south end of Hudson Bay, as the world now knows, is cut sharply by a ridge of swampy land that shoals to muddy flats in what is known as Hannah Bay.Hudson's hopes must have been dimmed if not dashed as he saw the western shore turn north and bar his way.

When he was in the sixth grade, he wrote his first short story titled the land of the unborn dogs. His teacher was very impressed with the story, however; she did not believe that he possessed the ability to create such an imaginative and creative story. After the experience of being discredited, Clyde laid down his pencil never to write another story. Over the years, he has told many stories while in high school and serving in the military to entertain his army buddies. After the military, he told stories to children when he was a day-camp counselor in the early eighties. In 1988, Clyde answered the call of God and entered the preaching ministry. Right away his ability to tell stories and his sermon writing revealed the talent that was tucked away. In 1993 after being in the preaching ministry for five years, Clyde entered college and earned a B.A. degree in Bible and Ministries from Bethel University, a liberal arts college in Mishawaka, Indiana. The author of the hip-hop Gospel ""Choir Boy"", Clyde has discovered that the Gospel message of Jesus cannot and should not be limited to the pulpits on Sunday mornings packaged in three-point sermons."

9780268200367,"The first full-length biography of William Still, one of the most important leaders of the Underground Railroad.William Still: The Underground Railroad and the Angel at Philadelphia is the first major biography of the free black abolitionist William Still, who coordinated the Eastern Line of the Underground Railroad and was a pillar of the Railroad as a whole. Based in Philadelphia, Still built a reputation as a courageous leader, writer, philanthropist, and guide for fugitive slaves. This monumental work details Still's life story beginning with his parents' escape from bondage in the early nineteenth century and continuing through his youth and adulthood as one of the nation's most important Underground Railroad agents and, later, as an early civil rights pioneer. Still worked personally with Harriet Tubman, assisted the family of John Brown, helped Brown's associates escape from Harper's Ferry after their famous raid, and was a rival to Frederick Douglass among nationally prominent African American abolitionists. Still's life story is told in the broader context of the anti-slavery movement, Philadelphia Quaker and free black history, and the generational conflict that occurred between Still and a younger group of free black activists led by Octavius Catto.Unique to this book is an accessible and detailed database of the 995 fugitives Still helped escape from the South to the North and Canada between 1853 and 1861. The database contains twenty different fields--including name, age, gender, skin color, date of escape, place of origin, mode of transportation, and literacy--and serves as a valuable aid for scholars by offering the opportunity to find new information, and therefore a new perspective, on runaway slaves who escaped on the Eastern Line of the Underground Railroad. Based on Still's own writings and a multivariate statistical analysis of the database of the runaways he assisted on their escape to freedom, the book challenges previously accepted interpretations of the Underground Railroad. The audience for William Still is a diverse one, including scholars and general readers interested in the history of the anti-slavery movement and the operation of the Underground Railroad, as well as genealogists tracing African American ancestors."

The author wanted to convey simple words to bring out the deepest emotions many people choose not to show either because they think it's a sign of weakness or not manly. It was a way for the author to his head straight from life. The author chose to share his thoughts with the world to help those who think there is no one to help them. Knowing everyone has different ways of dealing with life's crazy turns, just remember to always look on the brighter side of things and push forward. Know when one takes a chance to experience new things because they simply never know where it can lead you. Life is too short to dwell on what was. Focus on what one can take from their past to create a brighter future.Writing is very therapeutic for the heart, mind, and soul. As you read this book, you will experience love, passion, anguish, self-doubt, compassion, and eventually hope. There is help everywhere. Talk to a close friend or family member, write, sing, play an instrument, and find what works. Don't waste time because it is short and valuable. Cherish every moment because life will always throw a curveball!The author's hope is that after the reader finishes reading this book, they'll understand that even though people have different circumstances, they all still have basic and fundamental commonality, and that's being human.2"

The Internet once promised to be a place of extraordinary freedom beyond the control of money or politics, but today corporations and platforms exercise more control over our ability to access information and share knowledge to a greater extent than any state. From the online calls to arms in the thick of the Arab Spring to the contemporary front line of misinformation, Jillian York charts the war over our digital rights. She looks at both how the big corporations have become unaccountable censors, and the devastating impact it has had on those who have been censored. In Silicon Values, leading campaigner Jillian York, looks at how our rights have become increasingly undermined by the major corporations desire to harvest our personal data and turn it into profit. She also looks at how governments have used the same technology to monitor citizens and threatened our ability to communicate. As a result our daily lives, and private thoughts, are being policed in an unprecedented manner. Who decides the difference between political debate and hate speech? How does this impact on our identity, our ability to create communities and to protest? Who regulates the censors? In response to this threat to our democracy, York proposes a user-powered movement against the platforms that demands change and a new form of ownership over our own data."

The Bergkonge has sent an army of dark elves and frost giants to put an end to the resistance against his rule once and for all. In Lund the combined powers of the humans, dwarves, light elves, and the guardians of the arm rings of Yngvar wait to face those of the mountain king. For them, destroying the Bergkonge is not a matter of pride or a desire for victory, it is all about survival. Not only for Midgard, but all of the nine realms.  Trapped in the dreamworld by the Bergkonge, the children of the heroes of the Danelands struggle to find a way to escape. Their mission to unlock the path to the Bergkonge's lair complete, they long to return home to help fight in the final battle.  As the frost giants attack Lund, it seems as though the guardians of the arm rings of Yngvar will hold the city on their own, but the queen of the dark elves has yet to attack, and the Bergkonge has yet to call his most deadly warriors to the battlefield.  More than lives are on the line as the alliance between those in Lund, held together by the heroes of the Danelands, makes its one and only stand against the darkness of the mountain king.

As in many boomtowns in the American West, its sudden prosperity attracted businessmen, outlaws, grifters, gamblers, prostitutes, and preachers. It wasn't long before there was a desperate need for lawmen and law enforcement. Outlaws like Johnny Ringo, Curly Bill Brocius, Buckskin Frank Leslie, Burt Alvord, and a handful of other lesser known criminals, all faced off with the legendary lawmen, including the Earp brothers-Wyatt, Virgil, Morgan, and Warren-who to one degree or another represented law enforcement in this wild, no-holds-barred town. In addition to Tombstone's reputation as a setting for colorful outlaw-lawman confrontations, it is also associated with a number of compelling and baffling mysteries. Ghosts are reported to roam the old taverns, hotels, opera houses, and other buildings. Eerie and unexplainable sounds and sights have been associated with Boot Hill, the famous cemetery, as well as the New City Cemetery.

This first volume, about both series, focuses on the cuneiform tablets on which the texts were written, from the British Museum, London, the Vorderasiatisches Museum, Berlin, and the Oriental Institute, Chicago. New hand copies and sketches show the physical and non-physical joins. Viewing the tablets as archaeological objects, the author provides numerous observations about format, shape, colour, 'firing holes', worm holes and trace fossils. The ways scribes marked out their tablets with horizontal lines (sometimes doubled) to separate entries or paragraphs or provide ruled tablets are described; vertical rulings defined the left edge and column divisions (sometimes replaced by a glossenkeil). Areas reserved for writing, layout, slanted lines of writing, alignment and indentation of paragraphs, line spacing and ductus (especially changes from middle to neo-assyrian) are carefully examined. the last chapter concentrates on scribal corrections and various correction marks, line markers and supplementary glosses. Such features illuminate the personal preferences and professional experience of the frequently anonymous scribes behind the tablets."

The witch who lived there recognized the darkness in my soul and took me under her wing-to witness her reign of terror firsthand and eventually, to inherit her legacy as my own. Now I'm the monster they fear; the one humans avoid at all costs. In this welcome isolation, I've attempted to forget my past and the future that was taken from me. Until three men appear, somehow able to break through my protective wards and see me in my true form. While resistant to their intrusion, I recognize they may be the ones I've been waiting for-the ones I need to ascend to my full power. Too bad I would rather grind their bones than invite them in. But something is mysteriously devouring the forest, and I suspect the threat may be the same one I barely escaped many moons ago.

But as much as he cares about you, me, and well, just about everybody, his love for his mom is what puts the true twinkle in his eye, the deeper dimple in his smile, and the pitter-pat in his heart. For this, he will pay the price.Despite all the valiant efforts to turn her body into a toxic vessel of waste, Mom now faces a gruesome death, awash in misbegotten filth, which can only be forestalled by an amazing, dazzling, awe-inspiring medical feat performed by a troupe of traveling surgical magicians. But their stunts don't come cheap, and Mom is freshly banished from work.

Well, maybe a few dozen.

And he comes into the watchful gaze of characters even more dangerous than chess players.After bicycling his way through death and mayhem, dragging his mind through eleven dimensions, and staying up way past his bed time, he finds himself naked in the dark, under the scrutiny of the filthy world outside his hometown. And he discovers there are more ways to be checkmated than he'd ever thought possible.As precious hours tick away for Mom, this young whiz kid embarks on a bloody and destructive adventure across the faces of an Earth slathered with pavement, adorned with commercial strips, bejeweled with litter, perfumed with smog, and crawling with tens of billions of increasingly tear-thirsty inhabitants who want nothing more than to checkmate him.As the twinkle in his eye fades, our hero braves caverns full of subterranean beasts, menageries of rutting perverts, a ruthless megalopolis, an uncaring desert, a megalomaniacal cyborg, and downright rudeness, all the while pursued by a gang of junkie bounty hunters, desperate for their next fix, and a murderous breakfast fanatic who believes the key to restoring balance and nutrition to the universe is this boy, the kid from the door next to dystopia."

9781588384416,"A much-needed perspective. -- Library Journal Starred Review The wisdom acquired during C. T. Vivian's nine decades is generously shared in It's in the Action, the civil rights legend's memoir of his life and times in the movement. Born in Missouri in 1924, Vivian lived twenty-four years in Illinois before moving to Nashville, where he earned a degree in theology and joined John Lewis, Diane Nash, and others to integrate the city in 1960. After being imprisoned and beaten during the Freedom Rides, he joined Dr. King at the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in Atlanta and played leading roles in integration and voting rights campaigns in Birmingham, St. Augustine, and Selma. Over the next half century, he became internationally known for his work for education and civil and human rights and against racism, hatred, and economic inequality. In 2013, Barack Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Vivian passed away peacefully in Atlanta on July 17, 2020. Vivian was never defined by discrimination and hardship, although he faced many instances of both. The late civil rights leader's heart-wrenching and inspiring stories from a lifetime of nonviolent activism come just in time for a new generation of activists, similarly responding to systems of injustice, violence, and oppression. It's in the Action is a record of a life dedicated to selflessness and morality, qualities achieved by Vivian that we can all aspire to. Bearing a foreword from Andrew Young, the memoir is an important addition to civil rights history and to the understanding of movement principles and strategies."

Hunley published two volumes of poetry in 2004: The Tongue, described by Philip Dacey as having ""the kind of insouciance praised by Whitman and practiced by a Buster Keaton or Harold Lloyd"", and Still, There's a Glimmer, which Barbara L. Hamby called a collection of ""shout-out-loud poems."" Hunley followed that up in 2008 with Octopus, winner of The Holland Prize, which Thomas Lux praised for its ""completely unsentimental poems about children and marriage; angry poems and poems of deep gratitude; poems both comic and dark (often simultaneously); and maybe most of all a clear, original, passionate American voice."" His fourth collection, Plunk,  published in 2015, was described by Lynn Domina as ""ironic and loquacious and wily. . . . energetic and energizing, and, basically, fun to read and to read aloud."" Hunley followed that up with two project books: The State That Springfield Is In (2016), consisting of forty dramatic monologues in the voices of characters from The Simpsons; and Here Lies (2018), consisting of forty-nine self-epitaphs. Of the former, Jason Bredle wrote ""The results are not only playful and fun, but also deeply autobiographical, with deftly focused attention to formal diversity and voice."" Of the latter, Bob Hicok wrote that [Hunley's] ""cornucopian appetites are served by an imagination of equal scope.""

9781526759269,"Full and comprehensive account of the origins, design, and of the A-10A Warthog.The Fairchild-Republic A-10A Close Support aircraft has become a legend over its long front line life. Known as the Warthog due to her unusual appearance, this little aircraft has built up an awesome reputation in the specialized ground-attack role, where her accuracy and deadliness are widely recognized as the best of their kind.Hard lessons from the Second World War, that were reinforced by the bitter experience of the Vietnam War two decades later, showed that it was both impracticable and highly non-cost efficient to use supersonic fighter jets in the close air support mission. A requirement was therefore drawn up for an aeroplane capable of carrying a heavy and varied load of ordnance, which had good endurance and unprecedented maneuverability, and which could survive heavy ground fire - thus the A-10 was born. But, by the time it came into service her role had changed to that of a tank-buster in the defense of Western Europe in the face of the overwhelming numbers of Soviet battle armor.With her straight wing, twin tails and turbine engines mounted high on her rear fuselage, this single-seat aircraft certainly presented a unique appearance. But all these features served a vital role, as Peter C. Smith explains in this highly detailed study.Although the Warthog's expected missions on the plains of Germany did not materialize, she did destroy hundreds of Soviet-built tanks during the Gulf wars. The A-10 has also flown almost continuous missions over the Balkans, against the Taliban in Afghanistan, and ISIS in Iraq and Syria.In this beautifully illustrated and comprehensive volume, Peter C Smith brings the A-10's incredible story right up to date."

The underlying issue is that the Evil that has infected the 'Roman' Catholic Church is the same Evil that affects governments and all religions and institutions when unbridled power is appropriated in the hands of one or a few, instead of from, by, and of God. Evil has enslaved human nature to Power, Money, Sex, and Hedonism This book is not an attack on the Catholic Church, but to expose the systemic Evil that has infected the Catholic Church for centuries because of the 'Roman' empire's influence. It is also an invitation to reform by the wisdom of the Holy Spirit and 'What to do' in the meantime for the faithful as part of the 'Remnant' promised by Jesus for the end times. Jesus gave us the answer and the way through the whole mess, and that is the Holy Spirit. Who then is the Holy Spirit and how do we experience the Spirit's unconditional love, wisdom, guidance, and power?""The Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you ALL things and will remind you of everything I have told you."" (John 14:26)  THE 'ROMAN' CATHOLIC CHURCH: Like all humans, as the Church grew, it was tempted by Original Sin to appropriate power and authority to itself, to be like God and the sole dispensers of the divine. - Whether knowing it or not the Roman Empire imposed their political and government structure on Christianity, placing the Holy Spirit under the umbrella of the Church. - Gradually, Christianity became more political to appease both the spiritual and political needs of the people. This kind of reasoning opened the door for Evil, as it did in the Garden of Eden, for authority, power, and the gifts of the Holy Spirit to only be in the hands of men who occupied appointed offices. Only a bishop could discern the Holy Spirit.Only a priest could anoint and preside at Eucharist and hear Confessions.Only deacons and priests could preach, perform marriages, and bless.  Now the gifts of the Holy Spirit were no longer given to whomever the Spirit chose, but only to these who held the government appointed offices- the pope, local bishops, pastors, and local clergy. - THE RESULT: Leadership and Clergy In the 'Roman' Church had the office and authority, but many lacked the gifts of the Holy Spirit.

9780226789903,"For more than two thousand years. Aristotle's ""Art of Rhetoric"" has shaped thought on the theory and practice of rhetoric, the art of persuasive speech. In three sections, Aristotle discusses what rhetoric is, as well as the three kinds of rhetoric (deliberative, judicial, and epideictic), the three rhetorical modes of persuasion, and the diction, style, and necessary parts of a successful speech. Throughout, Aristotle defends rhetoric as an art and a crucial tool for deliberative politics while also recognizing its capacity to be misused by unscrupulous politicians to mislead or illegitimately persuade others.  Here Robert C. Bartlett offers a literal, yet easily readable, new translation of Aristotle's ""Art of Rhetoric,"" one that takes into account important alternatives in the manuscript and is fully annotated to explain historical, literary, and other allusions.

9781509545766,"The concept of free will is profoundly important to our self-understanding, our interpersonal relationships, and our moral and legal practices. If it turns out that no one is ever free and morally responsible, what would that mean for society, morality, meaning, and the law? Just Deserts brings together two philosophers - Daniel C. Dennett and Gregg D. Caruso - to debate their respective views on free will, moral responsibility, and legal punishment. In three extended conversations, Dennett and Caruso present their arguments for and against the existence of free will and debate their implications. Dennett argues that the kind of free will required for moral responsibility is compatible with determinism - for him, self-control is key; we are not responsible for becoming responsible, but are responsible for staying responsible, for keeping would-be puppeteers at bay. Caruso takes the opposite view, arguing that who we are and what we do is ultimately the result of factors beyond our control, and because of this we are never morally responsible for our actions in the sense that would make us truly deserving of blame and praise, punishment and reward. Just Deserts introduces the concepts central to the debate about free will and moral responsibility by way of an entertaining, rigorous, and sometimes heated philosophical dialogue between two leading thinkers."

These shepherds are called to preach, pray, and care for the needs of God's people. But what does it mean to be a pastor? And what is the nature of this ministry, according to the Bible?In Gospel-Driven Ministry, Jared Wilson begins by looking at the qualifications for the pastorate, addressing the notion of a call to ministry and how an individual--and a church community--can best identify the marks of maturity and affirm a call. In each chapter, Wilson looks at one of the core practices of pastoral ministry, including: Preaching SermonsDeveloping a Vibrant Prayer LifeCaring and CounselingPastoring Married and SingleGospel-Centered LeadershipFighting Sin and Spiritual WarfareResolving ConflictPassing on the Ministry to OthersIn addition, Wilson provides practical resources including theological insights on baptism and the Lord's Supper, guidance for wedding and funeral sermons, outlines for leading elder and deacon meetings, tips for interviewing new pastors, questions to ask at ordination, and advice on knowing when and how to leave a pastor role.

9781646021116," The past fifty years have seen a strong interest in the shape and the message of the book of Psalms. In A Voice Without End, Andrew C. Witt evaluates the significance of Psalms 3-14, and in particular, the presence and function of the figure of David.  Using representative interpreters and canonical and literary approaches, Witt uncovers how the book of Psalms develops its own speaking personae. He argues that the introduction to the book in Psalms 1-2 and the association with David in the superscriptions set up the figure of David as the principal voice within Psalms 3-14, constructing a Davidic persona who can speak as an ideal and representative figure, as well as a typological figure, in expectation of the establishment of a just kingdom in the context of the Davidic promises. In addition to its original analysis of Psalms 3-14, this study contributes to Psalms research by sharpening our understanding of the Davidic voice and by showing that key themes and motifs at the seams of the Psalter and in its thematic center are already active and engaged at the very beginning. Further, it helps to bridge premodern and modern psalm interpreters by demonstrating the ongoing value of premodern conceptual models for analyzing voices in the text. Pathbreaking and eminently readable, this book changes both the way we read the Psalter and how we understand its relationship with David. It will appeal to biblical studies scholars and seminarians."

Since emotionally intelligent people tend to get along with others better and be more empathetic and caring, they are likely to be more effective than their counterparts.

9781952043123,"Floyd was the most infamous bank robber of his time. From his early teens, Floyd believed that crime would lead to happiness and prosperity. But after each crime, he ended up back in prison, planning his next escape, his next big job. In 1974, he and three others pulled off a one-million-dollar heist, but it didn't end up the way he planned. This book is a personal account of Forsberg's life of crime, beginning with burglary and purse snatching, then car theft, forging of stolen money orders, assault, attempted bank robbery, bank robbery, and finally accessory to murder. He details his crimes in a very personal way, and his time in a number of institutions and his criminal beliefs are laid bare. One comes away with an understanding of the various aspects of the life of a criminal. As much as this book reveals criminal behavior and the particulars about living in a penal institution, it is less about prison walls or institutional systems than it is about what Floyd discovered about himself that caused him to give up his life of crime. It's about why he decided to stop his psychopathic thinking and become a productive member of society. "

9780806168548,"While political history has plenty to say about the impact of Ronald Reagan's election to the presidency in 1980, four Senate races that same year have garnered far less attention--despite their similarly profound political effect. Tuesday Night Massacre looks at those races. In examining the defeat in 1980 of Idaho's Frank Church, South Dakota's George McGovern, John Culver of Iowa, and Birch Bayh of Indiana, Marc C. Johnson tells the story of the beginnings of the divisive partisanship that has become a constant feature of American politics.  The turnover of these seats not only allowed Republicans to gain control of the Senate for the first time since 1954 but also fundamentally altered the conduct of American politics. The incumbents were politicians of national reputation who often worked with members of the other party to accomplish significant legislative objectives--but they were, Johnson suggests, unprepared and ill-equipped to counter nakedly negative emotional appeals to the ""politically passive voter.""  Such was the campaign of the National Conservative Political Action Committee (NCPAC), the organization founded by several young conservative political activists who targeted these four senators for defeat. Johnson describes how such groups, amassing a great amount of money, could make outrageous and devastating claims about incumbents--""baby killers"" who were ""soft on communism,"" for example--on behalf of a candidate who remained above the fray. Among the key players in this sordid drama are NCPAC chairman Terry Dolan; Washington lobbyist Charles Black, a top GOP advisor to several presidential campaigns and one-time business partner of Paul Manafort; and Roger Stone, self-described ""dirty trickster"" for Richard Nixon and confidant of Donald Trump.  Connecting the dots between the Goldwater era of the 1960s and the ascent of Trump, Tuesday Night Massacre charts the radicalization of the Republican Party and the rise of the independent expenditure campaign, with its divisive, negative techniques, a change that has deeply--and perhaps permanently--warped the culture of bipartisanship that once prevailed in American politics.

9781509936069,"This book provides a comprehensive analysis of an often neglected, misunderstood and maligned source of international law. Article 38(1)(c) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice sets out that the Court will apply the 'general principles of law recognized by civilized nations'. This source is variously lauded and criticised: held up as a panacea to all international law woes or denied even normative validity. The contrasting views and treatments of General Principles stem from a lack of a model of the source itself. This book provides that model, offering a new and rigorous understanding of Article 38(1)(c) that will be of immense value to scholars and practitioners of international law alike.  At the heart of the book is a new tetrahedral framework of analysis - looking to function, type, methodologyand jurisprudential legitimacy. Adopting an historical approach, the book traces the development of the source from 1875 to 2019, encompassing jurisprudence of the Permanent Court of International Justice and the International Court of Justice as well as cases from international criminal tribunals, the International Criminal Court and the World Trade Organisation. The book argues for precision in identifying cases that actually apply General Principles, and builds upon these 'proper use' cases to advance a comprehensive model of General Principles, advocating for a global approach to the methodology of the source."

9780567696731,"John C. Poirier examines the ""theopneustic"" nature of the Scripture, as a response to the view that ""inspiration"" lies at the heart of most contemporary Christian theology. In contrast to the traditional rendering of the Greek word theopneustos as ""God-inspired"" in 2 Tim 3:16, Poirier argues that a close look at first- and second-century uses of theopneustos reveals that the traditional inspirationist understanding of the term did not arise until the time of Origen in the early third century CE, and that in every pre-Origen use of theopneustos the word instead means ""life-giving.""Poirier thus conducts a detailed investigation of theopneustos as it appears in the fifth Sibylline Oracle, the Testament of Abraham, Vettius Valens, Pseudo-Plutarch (Placita Philosophorum), and Pseudo-Phocylides, all of whom understand the word to mean ""life-giving."" He also studies the use of the cognate term theopnous in Numenius, the Corpus Hermeticum, on an inscription at the Great Sphinx of Giza, and on an inscription at a nymphaeum at Laodicea on the Lycus. Poirier argues that a rendering of ""life-giving"" also fits better within the context of 2 Tim 3:16, and that this meaning survived late enough to figure in a fifth-century work by Nonnus of Panopolis. He further traces the pre-Origen use of theopneustos among the Church Fathers. Poirier concludes by addressing the implication of rethinking the traditional understanding of Scripture, stressing that the lack of ""God-inspired"" scripture ultimately does not affect the truth status of the gospel as preached by the apostles."

9781407356433,"Archaeologists consider Puerto Rico a key geographical location for categorizing native occupations in the Caribbean. However, lack of funding, minimal focus on petroglyph research, and limited historical records has reduced Puerto Rico's contributions to the broader archaeological conversation. This book hopes to alleviate this issue through its interdisciplinary analysis of the La Mina site, a previously unrecorded petroglyph site near the El Yunque National Forest in Municipio de Naguabo, Puerto Rico. The authors' 2015 fieldwork consisted of a Phase I geological and archaeological survey and the cataloguing of Rex Cauldwell's longitudinal photographic study of the site (2006-2018), both of which included the documentation of dozens of previously unrecorded preTa no/Ta no glyphs. In 2017-2018, they supplemented the initial fieldwork with additional ethnographic data, focusing on the aftermath of recent natural disasters and cultural unrest in the region. "

In the search for the culprit, Macdonald and his team of detectives must figure out if one of the members of the studio party is somehow involved in the death, or if some other scurrilous neighbour could be responsible.The British Library of Crime Classics is pleased to revive this clever, classic mystery for amateur sleuths and fans of British historical fiction."

9781513271675,"Trent's Last Case (1913) is a detective novel by E.C. Bentley. Adapted three times for the cinema--including a 1952 feature film starring Michael Wilding, Orson Welles, and Margaret Lockwood--Trent's Last Case, which was titled The Woman in Black in the U.S., earned the acclaim of such writers as Dorothy L. Sayers, and was followed by a sequel and a collection of short stories involving its main character. When Sigsbee Manderson, a prominent American plutocrat, is murdered at his country estate in southwest England, Philip Trent, an amateur detective and freelance journalist, is hired to investigate the case. Aided by police, Trent begins his examination of the facts and evidence. Granted access to the body as well as the grounds of White Gables, Manderson's estate, Trent concludes his investigation with a series of interviews. Beginning with Manderson's wife, he uses his journalistic skill to collect information from the plutocrat's secretaries, servant, and maid, as well as Nathaniel Cupples, Mrs. Manderson's uncle and an old friend of Trent's. When the coroner's report is released, and in coordination with his own research, evidence suggests that Manderson was murdered due to some unknown business vendetta. There is reason to believe, however, that his death could have something to do with his troubled marriage, a possibility complicated by Trent's growing attraction to Mabel, his widow. Unable to reach a conclusion, Trent embarks for Latvia to work as a traveling correspondent, but no matter how much time or distance he places between himself and White Gables, the questions and the mystery remain. Trent's Last Case is a masterful detective novel by a writer whose reputation has unjustly faded over the past several decades. With a beautifully designed cover and professionally typeset manuscript, this edition of E.C. Bentley's Trent's Last Case is a classic of English detective fiction reimagined for modern readers."

9780472132294,"Ghostly Fragments gathers the essays of the late Barbara C. Hodgdon, a renowned scholar of Shakespeare and performance studies. Her influential publications over thirty years reflected a remarkable intelligence, wit, and originality, as did her lectures and conference papers. Richard Abel and Peter Holland have selected essays that represent the wide sweep of Hodgdon's scholarship, including unpublished pieces and those from hard-to-access sources. The essays reveal a thinker and writer who grows more self-reflective over time, with a distinctive, engaging, often wryly humorous voice that is accessible even to nonspecialist readers.  Following a general introduction by Peter Holland, the book's five subsections (Teaching Shakespeare, Analyzing Stage Performances, Editing Shakespeare Texts, Analyzing Shakespeare Films, and ""Shopping"" in the Archives) are introduced in turn by scholars Miriam Gilbert, W.B. Worthen, Margaret Jane Kidnie, Richard Abel, and Pascale Aebischer. Collectively, the pieces confirm the originality and  lan of Hodgdon's thinking and writing over time, and reveal her as a natural essayist and stylist, with a distinctive engaging voice. The collection is unique in not only bringing together so much of Hodgdon's work in one place (with an extensive bibliography of her published work) but also in demonstrating how groundbreaking and influential that work has been in the field."

9780593082782,"Las soluciones que ya tenemos y los avances que a n necesitamos En este libro urgente y necesario Bill Gates propone un plan amplio, pr ctico --y comprensible-- para conseguir que el mundo llegue a cero emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero para as  evitar una cat strofe clim tica. Bill Gates ha pasado una d cada investigando las causas y efectos del cambio clim tico. Con la ayuda de expertos en los campos de la f sica, la qu mica, la biolog a, la ingenier a, las ciencias pol ticas y las finanzas, se ha centrado en investigar exactamente qu  se debe hacer para detener la deriva del planeta hacia un desastre ambiental. En este libro, adem s de explicar por qu  debemos esforzarnos en lograr emisiones netas cero de gases de efecto invernadero, tambi n detalla lo que debemos hacer para lograr este objetivo tan importante. Gates nos presenta una descripci n clara de los desaf os que enfrentamos. A partir de su conocimiento sobre innovaci n y lo que se requiere para introducir nuevas ideas en el mercado, describe las  reas en las que la tecnolog a ya est  ayudando a reducir las emisiones, d nde y c mo la tecnolog a actual puede funcionar de manera m s eficaz, d nde es necesario desarrollar tecnolog as de punta, y qui n est  trabajando en estas innovaciones esenciales. Finalmente, presenta un plan concreto y pr ctico para lograr el objetivo de cero emisiones, sugiriendo no solo las pol ticas que los gobiernos deber an adoptar, sino lo que nosotros, como individuos, podemos hacer para que nuestro gobierno, nuestros empleadores y nosotros mismos nos responsabilicemos esta crucial iniciativa. Como deja claro Bill Gates, llegar a cero emisiones no ser  sencillo ni f cil, pero si seguimos el plan que aqu  propone, es una meta que se encuentra decididamente a nuestro alcance. ""Para detener el calentamiento global y evitar los peores efectos del cambio clim tico, los humanos deben dejar de agregar gases de efecto invernadero a la atm sfera. Si nada cambia, el mundo seguir  produciendo gases de efecto invernadero, el cambio clim tico seguir  empeorando y el impacto en los seres humanos con toda probabilidad ser  catastr fico.Pero las cosas pueden cambiar. Este libro trata sobre lo que se necesitar  para lograrlo y por qu  estoy convencido de que podemos hacerlo."" -- Bill Gates ENGLISH DESCRIPTION Bill Gates shares what he's learned in more than a decade of studying climate change and investing in innovations to address the problems, and sets out a vision for how the world can build the tools it needs to get to zero greenhouse gas emissions.  Bill Gates explains why he cares so deeply about climate change and what makes him optimistic that the world can avoid the most dire effects of the climate crisis. Gates says, We can work on a local, national, and global level to build the technologies, businesses, and industries to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. His interest in climate change is a natural outgrowth of the efforts by his foundation to reduce poverty and disease. Climate change, according to Gates, will have the biggest impact on the people who have done the least to cause it. As a technologist, he has seen firsthand how innovation can change the world. By investing in research, inventing new technologies, and by deploying them quickly at large scale, Gates believes climate change can be addressed in meaningful ways. According to Gates, to prevent the worst effects of climate change, we have to get to net-zero emissions of greenhouse gases. This problem is urgent, and the debate is complex, but I believe we can come together to invent new carbon-zero technologies, deploy the ones we have, and ultimately avoid a climate catastrophe."

En sus ya d cadas como profesor reconocido mundialmente, Richard Rohr ha ayudado a millones de personas a darse cuenta qu  es lo que est  en juego en materia de fe y espiritualidad. Aun as , Rohr nunca ha escrito sobre el tema m s perenne en el Cristianismo: Jes s. La mayor a sabe quien fue Jes s, pero  qui n fue Cristo?  Es esta palabra simplemente el apellido de Jes s? Con demasiada frecuencia, escribe Rohr, nuestras comprensiones han sido limitadas por la cultura, los debates religiosos, y la tendencia humana a ponernos a nosotros mismos en el centro. Recurriendo a las escrituras, la historia, y a la pr ctica espiritual, Rohr articula una visi n transformadora de Jesucristo como un retrato de la obra constante y en desarrollo de Dios en el mundo. ""Dios ama a las cosas convirti ndose en ellas"" -escribe-, y la vida de Jes s fue destinada a declarar que la humanidad nunca estuvo separada de Dios -excepto por su propia elecci n negativa. Cuando recuperamos esta verdad fundamental, la fe se vuelve menos acerca de probar que Jes s fue Dios, y m s acerca de aprender a reconocer que la presencia del Creador est  a nuestro alrededor, y en todos los que conocemos.Provocativo, pr ctico, lleno de una esperanza y visi n profunda, El Cristo Universal es un libro emblem tico de uno de los escritores espirituales m s amados y populares, y una invitaci n a contemplar como Dios libera y ama todo lo que hay."

Ex-soldier, ex-drunk, ex-tramp are titles he's eager to bury. He's building a new life at a neighborhood detective agency. And he's working on a solid relationship with his crime-fighting partner, Sabrina Ross. But without warning, Rook's past returns with a vengeance in the enticing form of his ex-wife. Visiting New York for a convention, Annie Perry is a self-made millionaire with more than business on her mind. She's confident, alluring, and ready to rekindle feelings Rook thought he'd left far behind. When Annie is murdered shortly after their reunion, her death sends Rook over the edge. To find her killer, he must delve into her past, even if it hurts. There's the oily vice president and the angelic business associate, plus the three thousand people who attended the conference. But Rook's suspicions focus on a clutch of university professors who buzzed around his ex-wife. Driven by grief and distracted by jealousy, Rook digs into fraught campus politics and buried scholarly history in his search for the truth. Violence and betrayal dog his investigation. Rook learns that envy, greed, and fraud are not merely academic. As he hunts Annie's killer, Rook's relentless quest uncovers clues to another mystery from the past, a case that strikes even closer to home. His boss's wife was talented, volatile, and troubled.

Haynes faced hardships: abuse and trauma, tumultuous relationships, frustrating career shifts, and-when she reached her mid-thirties-chronic illness. As she approached middle age and began to examine her life's many ups and downs, she discovered that while the circumstances are individual, the emotions they carry are collective. In Halfway There: Lessons at Midlife, Elizabeth shares some of her most personal stories (and the lessons she's learned) to help readers feel more empowered to embrace their own journeys. She writes with poignance, care, and a dash of humor about the many challenges humans face, such as: adversity and loss, frustrating career shifts, lack of purpose, childhood trauma, the pressure to fit in, conflicting beliefs, and chronic health issues. Her hope is for readers to come away with a better understanding of what it means to be human and how to grow older with grace."

9781662804496,"This book was written to spark enthusiasm for recognition of the presence of God's handiwork. This book is comprised of several stories; although each individual story is different, it is apparent that God is at work 'behind the scenes' by the end of every person's story. In the similar instance, Jacob also took notice of God's presence in Genesis 28:16 and we too tend to pick up on His presence after He has attempted to prove His presence time after time.So please relax with your drink of choice and take a gander at the individual stories. I assure you each one's story is both factual as well as intriguing.Though this is Marlon Jones' first book, I surmise you will discover that this book was a catalyst for the great storyteller that he is. He has a perspective and outlook on various situations. His unique knack for reflecting on his life makes room for the Holy Spirit to move throughout his life. He currently lives in Indianapolis, Indiana and he enjoys listening to music, reading and quiet time."
9781735047102,"The call and role of the Deacon are more important today than many realize. The current duties and responsibilities of the Deacon are more than just participating in devotion, taking care of Church business / finances, or maintaining the upkeep of Church facilities and grounds. The pages of this inspired work are meant to assist and guide the Deacon in ministry. The first intent of The Deacon's Guide is to facilitate an encounter with God through the Holy Scriptures and then the pursuit of a servant's heart. I pray that God will use this work to lead the Deacon toward a closer walk with Him and assist the Deacon in being more like our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. The format is rich in outline and very accessible in nature. It offers a controlled guiding hand to those who want to search the Scriptures for a better understanding of the office, and practical duties of the Christian Deacon within the organized Church. The Deacon's Guide focuses on what God requires of the Deacon, as identified and supported in the Bible and not the author's personal commentary. Many of our congregations are suffering due to the lack of biblical leadership. Some congregants are leaving traditional denominations because their ""Home Churches"" are not addressing or training leadership to adequately handle the affairs of today's Church and her members. Pastors cannot handle every issue that confronts the Church alone, nor should they. Pastors have ""Partners in Ministry,"" called Deacons.The Deacon's Guide focuses on the biblical role of the Deacon, with lessons such as ""Deacons As Partners with the Pastor,"" ""Deacons Meeting the Needs of the Church, ""The Deacons Family Ministry Plan,"" and ""Deacons Training New Deacons.""This guide also highlights the importance of less talked about aspects of the Deacon's Ministry, such as ""Deacons Caring for the Church's Widows,"" ""Church Etiquette for Deacons,"" and ""The Church's Deaconess Ministry. ""The Deacon's Guide also includes ""Special Topics and Contemporary Issues,"" with such topics as ""Evangelism and Street Ministry"", A Comparison: Baptist Deacons and A.M.E. Stewards,"" ""The Pulpit,"" and ""What Do Officers and Members Do When There Is No Pastor?"" Each lesson in The Deacon's Guide provides an excellent template for classroom training and / or use in sermon development. The Deacon's Guide is also written to aid young Pastors who perhaps have little or no experience with being co-laborers with Deacons. This will prove to be an invaluable guide for them. Finally, it is my hope that The Deacon's Guide will bring Glory to God and become a valuable resource in the pursuit of Christian Education and the equipping of God's people for service.--Dr. William C. Morgan, Author and Instructor"
9783777435732,"This book marks the triumphant return of Frida Kahlo to San Francisco, the city where her artistic life began to unfold. Kahlo's sojourns to the United States were brief, but formative. It was in the California city--the first she visited in the US--that she ventured into a new world beyond the scope of Coyoac n, Mexico City, and Cuernavaca.  Kahlo first visited San Francisco in 1930 with her husband Diego Rivera and stayed for a year while he completed murals for the City Club of San Francisco and the San Francisco Art Institute. It was love at first sight. Kahlo appreciated the beauty of the city, relished its ethnic diversity, and was mesmerized by neighborhoods like Chinatown. She met fascinating people, many of whom became lifelong friends. It was also in San Francisco that Kahlo began to fashion her indigenous (and now iconic) Mexican identity, deliberately distinguishing herself from the local women, whom she called ""scarecrows"" and ""dull."" Kahlo refined her sartorial flair, enhanced her political and social worldview, and began to paint seriously. Today she is recognized as a cultural icon, and one of the most critically acclaimed artists of the twentieth century.  Presented alongside a major exhibition at the de Young museum in San Francisco, this catalogue includes essays exploring Kahlo's role as an artist and her time in San Francisco, as well as a selection of artworks by the artist and photographs of her. Frida Kahlo and San Francisco provides a unique opportunity to examine the ways in which politics, gender, trauma, and national identity influenced Kahlo's diverse modes of creativity.

9781953447715,"Sepia-tinged nostalgia lures everyone in sooner or later. It's tempting to skip back over bridges burned so long ago we can't remember which one of us even held the match anymore. Everyone has plenty of emotional blind-spots. But how do you validate a memory when the one who holds the other half of your recollection is gone forever? Reyes Cardenas' newest writing collection, Flirting With The Past, oscillates between themes of ageing out of childhood and returning to a place that no longer exists. He's adopted a swift couplet-style, which is perfect because Cardenas' meter is quick bursts of expressive, combustible imagery. If the Barrio Gods allowed the 12-year old you to peek behind the curtain and speak with the 60-year old you, would you ask what happens to Dad- to Lupita- to Pete with the Honda bike? Most likely, you'd find ""sometimes your past and your future / meet up with each other to destroy themselves""."

Norman Shealy and Sergey Sorin are joined by experimental psychologist, Amber Massey-Abernathy, and by health-and-wellness counselor, Georgianne Ginder. Recovering Common Sense offers a program for lifelong physical, emotional, and spiritual health based in Five-Factor Theory (FFT) and the ""Five Health Basics."" The authors make two claims, both rather bold though backed by clinical practice and experiment. The first claim is medical: The FFT personality traits have hormonal expressions, such that openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism-the so-called ""big five"" of FFT-are mirrored in levels of dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, oxytocin, anandamide, and other neurotransmitters. Their second claim is medical as well, but turns from brain chemistry to patterns and habits of behavior. Personality traits-neuroticism and conscientiousness particularly-correlate with health and wellness. While FFT traits are genetic in origin and change slowly over time, it is their contention that one can, in fact, choose health by growing in conscientiousness. And, as they argue, the modalities of holistic medicine provide the means of growth. This book offers an outline of those modalities and of their role in conscientious health care. "

9780813585987,"Modern health care cannot exist without professional nurses. Throughout the twentieth century, there was seldom a sustained period when the supply of nurses was equal to demand. Nursing the Nation offers a historical analysis of the relationship between the development of nurse employment arrangements with patients and institutions and the appearance of nurse shortages from 1890 to 1950. The response to nursing supply and demand problems by health care institutions and policy-making organizations failed to address nurse workforce issues adequately, and this failure resulted in, at times, profound and lengthy nurse shortages. Nurses also lost the ability to control their own destiny within health care institutions while nevertheless establishing themselves as the most critical part of health care provision today."

9781098344658,"Paul C. Thornton is originally from Brooklyn and Long Island, New York. Cruising Interrupted is Paul's third book, a follow-up to the fun, upbeat, award-winning The Joy of Cruising. His cruise-themed books are a stark departure from his debut: White Man's Disease, a memoir described as gripping and inspiring in the press release announcing it as the winner of the North Street Book Prize, about Paul's harrowing brush with death, journey of recovery from trauma, resilience and ultimately transformation. White Man's Disease is at once poignant, sad, tragic and funny. Despite their very different subjects, at the heart of both White Man's Disease and The Joy of Cruising/Cruising Interrupted is passion and how passionate people do wondrous things. Paul lives in Fort Myers, Florida with his wife Cheryl and considers cruising with their grandchildren life's ultimate escape. Paul longs to cruise as much as the people he writes about in The Joy of Cruising and Cruising Interrupted."

9781838343903,"Why do most of us enjoy being alive? Psychologist Dr C A Soper argues that a zest for life evolved as a survival necessity, ultimately because our species, and ours alone, has to live with the possibility of suicide. Suicide may have been our ancestors' most formative evolutionary problem, solutions to which have shaped the construction of the human mind and touch on almost every aspect of our day-to-day experience. The emergence of anti-suicide defences by natural selection may explain our capacity for optimism, faith, love, charity and other delights of being human. This book explains how the most pleasing features of our psychology arise from the darkest of possibilities.Life worth living is thus traced to the evolution of suicide. A major cause of human mortality, suicide takes the lives of some million people around the world each year. The origins of the behaviour have long mystified science; despite more than a century of enquiry, science does not know why some people kill themselves, while most people don't. Progress in suicidology has been blocked, by what Soper sees as a fundamental flaw in the field's leading paradigm - the idea that suicides happen because of some, as yet unknown, predictable process of cause and effect. A new paradigm is offered, based on evolutionary science. Suicide is reframed as an evolutionary puzzle: how is that natural selection created an animal with the capacity to wilfully kill itself? The cost is extreme; measured by biological outcomes, suicide is literally a fate worse than death. Two existing evolutionary theories of suicide are critiqued and found wanting: a 'burdensomeness' and a 'communication' hypothesis. The behaviour is better understood, says Soper, as an unfortunate side effect of two adaptations that come together uniquely in our species. One is the aversive experience of pain, especially psychological pain - an ancient stimulus that is designed precisely to induce the animal to act to end it. The other is extraordinary intelligence of the mature human, an animal so smart that it knows it can end pain by ending its own life. When these 'pain' and 'brain' elements combine, as they do in all normal human adults, suicide would be the expectable outcome. The scientific puzzle, then, is not so much why some humans die in this way, but why the great majority of us do not.As the book explains, most of us do not take our own lives thanks to the protection afforded by ancient evolved psychological defences. An evolutionary argument of special design is used to predict some likely characteristics of anti-suicide systems - features that would be expected based on the task that they were biologically designed to fulfil. They would block suicidal trajectories by dulling emotional pain and disabling high-level cognitive functions among people suffering from chronic emotional distress. Perhaps counter-intuitively, this analysis points to diverse varieties of mental disorder - depression, addiction, psychoses, and others - as manifestations of emergency psychological defences, labelled keepers. Other anti-suicide defences, labelled fenders, are hypothesised to operate to ensure keepers activate only as a last resort. They work to keep most of us fairly happy most of the time, in part by furnishing each of us with a benign, but semi-illusory, enhanced reality to live in. In this light, the human tendencies for religious belief and unconditional love may be understood as part of a life-preserving system of psychological buffers.The book's 'pain and brain' theory provides a unifying explanation for several longstanding and puzzling phenomena in human psychology. It offers a novel paradigm that could integrate and assist progress in suicide research, psychiatry and psychotherapy."

Caledonia and her crew have fled to Cloudbreak to prepare for an all-out war. And they are not the only ones. Rogue ships and even a few defecting Bullets show up to join their fight. But Lir always seems to be one step ahead of Caledonia, anticipating her every more as he secures the seas for himself. With the fight growing desperate, Caledonia is forced to make an unlikely and unsteady alliance with a new enemy. It's a gamble that could cost her everything, but with the fate of the seas in her hands, Caledonia will do whatever it takes to win the war."

9780975973059," The Kwansaba is an African American verse form of praise created in 1995 by Eugene B. Redmond, East St. Louis Poet Laureate and professor of English at Southern Illinois-East St. Louis. The poems honor Kwanzaa, a celebration of family and African American culture, and praise writers such as Richard Wright and Sonia Sanchez. The poetic style of the Kwansaba utilizes the number seven, the numeric foundation of Kwanzaa. Thus, a Kwansaba is a heptastich, a poem of seven lines, with seven words in each line, and written with no word exceeding seven letters. Darline Roy talks about the strict rules of a Kwansaba. The idea was first used by Eugene B. Redmond and refined in the summer workshop of 2015. But there are exceptions to the rule of seven. He agrees that imposing some restriction makes you think about what you are writing. Another example of a kind of poem that has rules is a haiku, a very short form of Japanese poetry in which the first sentence has five syllables, the second line has seven syllables, and the last line has five syllables. In addition, the Kwansaba poetic form embraces its roots from the South African tradition of the praise poem, called the izibongo in Zulu. A praise poem offers veneration to a person, which was popular in the Middle Ages and continues to be embraced in African cultures today. However, the African praise poem is not restricted to this part of the continent and is not uniquely an African motif; it was used during the Renaissance in Europe. Moreover, the praise poem itself is the manifestation of the oral tradition of atavistic songs of the African ancestors.  The ""Other Poems"" featured in the later part of the book are digressive; they may follow the rules of the Kwansaba but sometimes do not offer praise. The subjects of the poems range from relationships to community.Kwansabas and Other Poems represents my interpretation of the art form, and hopefully, I have contributed to this particular type of poem, expanding its purview."
9781664221963," Do you know how Satan and demons can affect the course of your life? Many humanistic diagnoses of afflictions and distresses simply do not discover the reality of spirit intervention. A biblical world view should lead us to consider demonic influence and invasion. Some cases of depression, suicidal thoughts, physical afflictions, mental disturbances, and poor relationships are caused by wicked spirits. We need to be aware of the enemy's tactics and effects. This book will make you aware of the reality of warfare, the resources of the believer in Christ, and the authority to forcefully resist our adversaries.  ""This book is a wake up call to believers who are often unaware of this invisible enemy who attacks them, their families, and churches"" -Dr. Erwin Lutzer, Pastor Emeritus The MoodyChurch, Chicago"

9781098079833,"In this current crucial age that we live in, to say that the storms of life have increased with greater intensity is a severe understatement. We can agree that the intensity of the storms that we have encountered in recent times has increased exponentially. The torrential rains have flooded our lives with uncertainty and loss of direction. The strong accompanying winds of these storms have blown at a velocity that we never before could have imagined or comprehended. The aftermath of the winds has sometimes caused complete disorientation and disarray. These cataclysmic times have shaken some to their very core and have caused a massive upheaval in the foundations of others. We have been able to handle challenges and situations in our lives before recognizing them as just a part of life. However, it seems the challenges and situations are more complex, and they compound one after another, one on top of another. It has caused us to go back to the basics, and in introspection, we again seek out the truth of who we are and what our purpose is on this earth.There are three essential questions we need to establish in ourselves to ensure our foundations are solid. Our approach must be without previous assumption, cultural tradition, or societal influence.Our journey together will begin the discourse of the following fundamental questions as we discuss who Christ is, who you are, and who the church is."

9780664264765,"This revised edition of the popular textbook on worship by renowned hymn writer and professor Ruth C. Duck provides theological foundations for worship and explores the ways Christians have adapted worship to various cultures to help them live faithfully and to communicate the gospel to others. The author celebrates the many languages and cultural settings in which the gospel has been, and is, preached, sung, and prayed. The goal of this volume is to support good pastoral and congregational reflection on what worship is and does. Consequently, Duck discusses many different forms of worship from several cultures (African American, Asian, Euro-American) and offers advice on how to read a congregation and define its culture in order to plan culturally appropriate worship. She includes many practical suggestions for preparing and leading worship, including diverse ministries of music, movement, and visual arts that are becoming more popular today.From worship's theological underpinnings, the book turns to worship leadership, forms of prayer, preaching, the sacraments, ordination, and various other liturgies. Because of its emphasis on vital and Spirit-led worship, this comprehensive book on Christian worship will be used in years to come, not only as a core textbook for seminarians and ministry students from a variety of cultures and traditions but also as a resource for local church pastors and laity who are dedicated to the enlivening of Christian worship.In this new edition, Duck updates and expands the recommended resources, updates the section on worship trends, enhances the section on multicultural worship, and revises marriage information based on cultural and denominational changes. Highlights include stories of four churches that are developing creative ways to grow andmeet the possibilities and challenges of these times, especially in seeking justice, serving people in their neighborhood, and building bridges among cultures and religious groups. In addition, a new appendix by David Gambrell addresses the theological and practical questions surrounding online worship in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic and beyond."

Recalling the work of Remarque, Willi Heinrich, and especially Michael Herr, McCarthy's delirious narrative avoids cliche and raises intriguing questions about what it means to be human."" --Publishers Weekly (starred review) on Germline  ""It's not just good . . . it's the mil-sf book I wish I could send back in time to beat out Forever War for a Hugo. I never would have guessed McCarthy was an analyst . . . I was sure he'd been on the pointy end for a long time."" --Ernest Lilley, SF Revu  ""The highly detailed, brutal depiction of futuristic warfare brilliantly complements the intimate narrative, which examines the insanity of war and those personally affected by it. Breathtaking and heartrending, this is the future of military science fiction."" --Publishers Weekly (starred review)  ""A well written novel that makes you consider the costs of war in very personal terms."" --SF Signal"

9780197525791,"The civil rights movement was among the most important historical developments of the twentieth century and one of the most remarkable mass movements in American history. Not only did it decisively change the legal and political status of African Americans, but it prefigured as well the moralpremises and methods of struggle for other historically oppressed groups seeking equal standing in American society. And, yet, despite a vague, sometimes begrudging recognition of its immense import, more often than not the movement has been misrepresented and misunderstood. For the general public, a singular moment, frozen in time at the Lincoln Memorial, sums up much of what Americans know about that remarkable decade of struggle. In The Movement,  Thomas C. Holt provides an informed and nuanced understanding of the origins, character, and objectives of the mid-twentieth-century freedom struggle, privileging the aspirations and initiatives of the ordinary, grassroots people who made it. Holt conveys a sense of thesedevelopments as a social movement, one that shaped its participants even as they shaped it. He emphasizes the conditions of possibility that enabled the heroic initiatives of the common folk over those of their more celebrated leaders. This groundbreaking book reinserts the critical concept ofmovement back into our image and understanding of the civil rights movement."

The biblical teaching that Jesus was the Suffering Servant who carried the sins of His people when He went to the cross is vividly brought home to children in The Donkey Who Carried a King, the latest children's book from respected theologian, author, and educator Dr. R.C. Sproul. Memo was a young donkey who was bored and unhappy because he was never given anything to do. Then one day, some strangers came to the gate―and Memo's master picked him for a very special task. Memo carried the King, Jesus, into Jerusalem. A few days later, Memo saw some angry people making the King carry a heavy beam of wood. Memo could not understand it―until another donkey helped him see that the King was being a Servant on behalf of His people. The Donkey Who Carried a King offers a unique perspective on the events of Jesus' Passion Week and calls all believers, both young and old, to follow in the footsteps of the Suffering Servant for the glory of God. Jesus was willing to leave the glories of heaven to suffer and die in this world on our behalf, so we should serve Him with all our hearts. "

9780814214640,"Michelle Zerba's Modern Odysseys explores three major writers in global modernism from the Mediterranean, Anglo-European Britain, and the Caribbean whose groundbreaking literary works have never been studied together before. Using language as an instrument of revolution and social change, C. P. Cavafy, Virginia Woolf, and Aim  C saire gave expression to the forms of human experience we now associate with modernity: homoeroticism, transsexuality, and racial consciousness. More specifically, Zerba argues that Odyssean tropes of diffusion, isolation, passage, and return give form to works by these writers but in ways that invite us to reconsider and revise the basic premises of reception studies and intellectual history.  Combining close readings of literary texts with the study of interviews, essays, diaries, and letters, Zerba advances a revisionary account of how to approach relationships between antiquity and modernity. Instead of frontal encounters with the Odyssey,  Cavafy, Woolf, and C saire indirectly-but no less significantly-engage with Homer's epic poem. In demonstrating how such encounters operate, Modern Odysseys explores issues of race and sexuality that connect antiquity with the modern period."

His first-term policies had placed the United States in the ascendancy over the Soviet Union, and he sought to capitalize on that success by bringing the Cold War to an end on favorable terms. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, proved increasingly unable to bear the costs of supporting its empire and client state and adopted a strategy of détente. Its new leader Mikhail Gorbachev personified the new stance, and his rise to power in 1985 galvanized the U.S. administration's détente faction in renewed opposition to Reagan's strategy and advocacy of accommodation with Moscow.﻿"

A Native American language formerly spoken in hundreds of communities in the interior of California, Patwin (also known as Wintun Tʼewe) is now spoken by a small but growing number of language revitalizationists and their students. A Grammar of Patwin brings together two hundred years of word lists, notebooks, audio recordings, and manuscripts from archives across the United States and synthesizes this scattered collection into the first published description of the Patwin language. This book shines a light on the knowledge of past speakers and researchers with a clear and well-organized description supported by ample archival evidence.  Lewis C. Lawyer addresses the full range of grammatical structure with chapters on phonetics, phonology, nominals, nominal modifiers, spatial terms, verbs, and clauses. At every level of grammatical structure there is notable variation between dialects, and this variation is painstakingly described. An introductory chapter situates the language geographically and historically and also gives a detailed account of previous work on the language and of the archival materials on which the study is based. Throughout the process of writing this book, Lawyer remained in contact with Patwin communities and individuals, who helped to ensure that the content is appropriate from a cultural perspective.  "

As I testified in that case, other industrial designers have since asked me what does an industrial designer actually do during design patent litigation and how does one become an expert design witness.  This book will give you a glimpse into the career of one of the pioneering industrial designers to serve as an expert design witness in design patent litigation. My first case was in 1992 and I have been involved in about 100 cases since. The products involved include the appearance of bubble wrap, candles, dog food, internal combustion engines, motorized necktie racks, artificial fingernails, smartphones, bricks, toilet paper, scrunchies (elastic pony tail holders), corkscrews and class rings to name a few..  Woodring weaves his many personal experiences into his more pragmatic teachings, making his story a delightful read, full of surprises, humor and human-interest stories that unexpectedly occur during serious courtroom trials, often with millions at stake."

9781977236586,"Janet Andrews (a.k.a. Tinker Belle) has a unique gift; she understands the binary language of 1's and 0's, she's an infamous code writer. However, that gift comes with a steep price, she is naive to the nuances of social life, and is an easy mark for unscrupulous people. Her first venture beyond the safety of home was college, that ended in disaster and almost cost her life. It was a shadowy black ops group known as the Sentinels who rescued her, became her family, and encouraged her to use her coding skills to help maintain the scales of justice, no matter the cost. Even though her supercomputer gives her a portal into the lives of any electronically connected person or entity world-wide, she struggles to find answers in her personal life: who should she let into her private world; how truthfully should she answer their questions and share her hidden desires; and even more thought provoking - is she living life according to her rules or society's? Most know the proverb: ""Curiosity killed the cat,"" but few know the second part, ""Satisfaction brought it back."" Tinker knew and was willing to take the risk."

9781476682198,"He was Red Skelton's favorite director, and mentored Lucille Ball in the art of physical comedy. In his 15-year Hollywood career, S. Sylvan Simon (1910-1951) directed and/or produced more than 40 films, with stars like Lana Turner, Abbott and Costello, and Wallace Beery. Though he loved to make moviegoers laugh, he demonstrated his versatility with murder mysteries, war stories, and musicals. After a decade at MGM, he moved to Columbia, where he produced his own projects, including the Western melodrama Lust for Gold, and popular slapstick comedies like The Fuller Brush Girl. As head of production, reporting to irascible Harry Cohn, he produced the award-winning Born Yesterday, and was working on From Here to Eternity when his life ended tragically at the age of 41. This first-ever account of Simon's life and career draws on interviews with family and colleagues, genealogical records, archival materials, and his own annotated scripts to tell the story of a stage-struck boy from Pittsburgh whose talent and tenacity made him a Hollywood success. The filmography provides production histories, critical commentary, and excerpts from published reviews. An appendix covers books written or edited by Simon, including his anthologized plays for amateur groups."

Mom and Dad were out busily gathering food, and Junior was asleep in his comfortable bed waiting for them to return with breakfast when he was startled by the screeching of blackbirds flying in great numbers all around his tree home. In an instant, everything turned dark, and Junior sensed a huge weight upon him.

9781442260382,"Madam C. J. Walker-reputed to be America's first self-made woman millionaire-has long been celebrated for her rags-to-riches story. Born to former slaves in the Louisiana Delta in the aftermath of the Civil War, married at fourteen, and widowed at twenty, Walker spent the first decades of her life as a laundress, laboring in conditions that paralleled the lives of countless poor and working-class African American women. By the time of her death in 1919, however, Walker had refashioned herself into one of the most famous African American figures in the nation: the owner and president of a hair-care empire and a philanthropist wealthy enough to own a country estate near the Rockefellers in the prestigious New York town of Irvington-on-Hudson. In this biography, Erica Ball places this remarkable and largely forgotten life story in the context of Walker's times. Ball analyzes Walker's remarkable acts of self-fashioning, and explores the ways that Walker (and the Walker brand) enabled a new generation of African Americans to bridge the gap between a nineteenth-century agrarian past and a twentieth-century future as urban-dwelling consumers."

9781665514170,"Between January 26th and February 23rd of 1945 on Luzon in the Philippines, America made its greatest rescue of civilians and military prisoners from deep behind enemy lines. Three quickly organized raids by different hastily formed groups, saved 7,700 lives. Raids were necessary because a decoded Japanese order stated that prisoners were to be killed before rescue, an order executed in December '44 on Palawan Island in the Philippines. This book summarizes these raids and describes the prison camp experience of the author and his family. Photos, drawings, and old documents help tell the tale. In the largest raid on the prison at Santo Tomas in Manila, his family had 'ringside seats'. Theirs is a representative story of the prewar, war with its wretched conditions and postwar, and includes their experience under fire during the Battle of Manila. The book is a remembrance of the bravery, skills and organizing abilities displayed by American soldiers and Filipino/American guerillas, whose achievements are not likely to be surpassed. And of his parents, who pulled them through magnificently and were recognized, with others, by order of Gen. MacArthur with campaign ribbons with a battle star."

9788366673021,"As the first functional jet engines became available, the RLM published a requirement for a reconnaissance aircraft capable of long-range patrols over Britain, all the way up to Scapa Flow. The task to build the machine was given to Arado, who put R diger Kosin in charge of the design team. The initial E370 project was gradually tweaked and modified until it evolved into its final form as a single-seat aircraft powered by two jet engines in underwing pods, designated Ar 234. In order to maximize the aircraft's range, Arado's design team embarked on a radical weight-shedding crusade. Among the components eliminated from the design was conventional landing gear, which was replaced with a jettisonable three-wheel trolley used for take-offs and retractable skids mounted under the fuselage for landings. These design features were incorporated into the first A series prototypes, powered by Junkers Jumo 004A engines."

It was supposed to be the successor of the slightly outdated D-500 and D-510, built according to modern trends with a closed cabin and a retractable undercarriage. Unfortunately, the tests turned out to be very disappointing. At the same time, as part of the nationalization of the aviation industry, Dewoitine was incorporated into the SNCAM concern. The designer himself, however, did not give up the further development of the fighter and on his own, in cooperation with his engineers, developed a new design - designated D-520."

9798701704631,"Just as the then president of the United States, Barack Obama, wrote on May 16th, 2013 on his Twitter account: ""Ninety-seven percent of scientists agree that climate change is real, man-made and dangerous "", so the title of this book extracts the idea from that famous tweet, though the reality is that there is no such consensus of 97% of scientists that climate change is man-made and dangerous, though this message has been transmitted for decades by the mainstream media constantly and continuously, which has made it over time, without us realizing of it, an unquestionable truth accepted by the majority of the population.The theory of global warming or now called climate change, is simply one of the dogmas of a globalist agenda imposed by supranational entities to achieve their goals, and it is really this agenda that is real, man-made and dangerous.People who do not believe in the dangerous global warming theory are often branded as deniers, whereas those who believe in the existence of a New World Order imposed on nations as conspiracy believer people, but the truth is that the existence of this agenda and his not very good intentions are increasingly out of the question. Thus, the famous billionaire, David Rockefeller, a member of several globalist entities founded in the 20th century, including the Council on Foreign Relations, the Bilderberg Club and the Trilateral Commission, stated in his ""Memoirs"" book published in 2002: ""Some even believe we (the Rockefeller family) are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as 'internationalists' and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure - one world, if you will. If that's the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.""So from this statement we get two basic ideas: the first is that the globalist agenda exists, and second that it goes against the interests of sovereign nations, which of course indicates that its intentions are not very good.As if it were not enough proof of the existence of the globalist agenda, in 2020 at the World Economic Forum website it has been published openly and widely on the need for a Great political, economic and social world Reset, obviously imposed without counting on the opinion of ordinary citizens, and the need to take advantage of the Covid-19 pandemic crisis to further promote this great imposed global restart.In addition to man-made global warming, there are other dogmas in the globalist agenda in order to achieve its objectives, such as abortion, euthanasia, massive and uncontrolled migration, the legalization of drug trade, trafficking and consumption, etc. that mainly respond to two objectives of the globalist agenda: the reduction of the world population especially through the promotion of abortion and euthanasia, and the progressive erosion of the values of western democratic nations such as the family, along with the erosion of their national culture and identity, and the emptying of the sovereignty and authority of the national governments that will be transferred to globalist entities, for example through massive and uncontrolled migration or the legalization of drug trafficking and consumption.You might think that these elites who are imposing this agenda have good intentions deep down, since abortion, euthanasia, LGTBIQ + ideology, etc. are presented and defended as human rights of the people. However, these elites are not really interested in defending these rights, but only in what they can achieve with them: subverting the political, social and economic order of the nations in order to justify and achieve a new imposed world order.So the proof that the intentions of these elites are not really the defense of these rights, is that they try to impose an agenda which they have not been voted for."

9781735944722,"Immortality isn't all it's cracked up to be, especially for the 3,375-year-old virgin of Mount Olympus. Day after eternal day, Cupid launches his love-tipped arrows, then watches from the sidelines while everyone else has all the fun. His dull, sheltered existence takes an abrupt turn for the worse when he sends an arrow into the wrong rump.Banished by the gods, Cupid plunges to Earth and lands in present-day Tarra, Indiana, where mortals go on about their daily routines, oblivious to the capricious gods stirring the pot from above. Discovering that his wings and pubescent pudge have been replaced with an impressive human form, Cupid swiftly leaves his virginity behind, but his carnal spree comes to a screeching halt when he falls passionately in love for the first time in his immortal life. Soon, Cupid understands the full measure of his punishment: he must find the true Right Love match for the mortal he desperately loves, and then he must let her go.Caught between two worlds on a quest to fix Love, Cupid will have to master his own tortured heart and battle the powerful gods conspiring against him. Failure will not be tolerated; success will cost him everything."

9781433834554,"This book provides detailed guidance on assessing and accommodating patient preferences for the psychotherapist, the therapeutic approach, and treatment activities.  Blending empirical research and clinical expertise into easy-to-read advice, Drs. John Norcross and Mick Cooper offer multiple strategies for routinely assessing preferences as they evolve over the course of therapy, focusing primarily on strong likes and dislikes.  They describe multiple tools for rapidly and reliably measuring preferences in session, including their Cooper-Norcross Inventory of Preferences (C-NIP).  Four key strategies for accommodating a client's preferences are explored in depth: adopting them into treatment, adapting the therapist's approach, exploring alternative preferences, and referring the patient to another practitioner if necessary.  The authors describe the limitations of personalization and how to avoid common errors, such as therapists assuming they know what clients want. Training and supervision strategies are also featured.  Clinical cases and patient-therapist dialogues demonstrate how to evaluate and integrate client preferences in a respectful, ethical, and professional manner that leads to enhanced alliances and improved outcomes."

9781644690703,"One of the most basic questions for any legal system is that of methodology: how one interprets, analyzes, weighs, and applies a mass of often competing legal rules, precedents, practices, customs, and traditions to reach final determinations and practical guidance about the correct legal-prescribed course of action in any given situation. Questions of legal methodology raise not only practical concerns, but theoretical and philosophical ones as well. We expect law to be more than the arbitrary result of a given decision maker's personal preferences, and so we demand that legal methodologies be principled as well as practical. These issues are especially acute in religious legal systems, where the stakes are raised by concerns for respecting not just human, but divine law. Despite this, the major scholars and codifiers of halakhah, or Jewish law, have only rarely explicated their own methods for reaching principled legal decisions. This book explains the major jurisprudential factors driving the halakhic jurisprudence of Rabbi Yehiel Mikhel Epstein, twentieth-century author of the Arukh Hashulchan-the most comprehensive, seminal, and original modern restatement of Jewish law since Maimonides. Reasoning inductively from a broad review of hundreds of rulings from the Orach Chaim section of the Arukh Hashulchan,  the book teases out and explicates ten core halakhic principles that animate Rabbi Epstein's halakhic decision-making. Along the way, it compares the Arukh Hashulchan methodology to that of the Mishna Berura. This book will help any reader understand important methodological issues in both Jewish and general jurisprudence."
9781634992879,"Photographs of empty spaces provide us with an alternative view of the world without us. The images of empty spaces that were once lively capture a departure from our norms and instead project alternative realities emptied of our presence. In Washington, D.C., a province rich with our nation's history, anything abandoned is either hastily torn down, tagged, or senselessly vandalized. Still, some forlorn structures remain and hold timeless beauty, or better yet, have a second chance at life along with the preservation of history. The author's collection of abandonments, forgotten or repurposed, includes several historic schools, a famous psychiatric hospital, a veterans' home, some industrial sites, and a few artful public statements about our society. Additionally, she includes the surreal deserted representation of Washington, D.C., in the time of COVID-19. With streets devoid of its usual grid-locked traffic and pedestrians, haunting images of familiar places become unfamiliar. Like a collection of abandoned photos, Washington D.C.'s surroundings, only recently integral to daily habits, now seem fragile and tenuous. Washington, D.C.'s deserted public spaces expose the new and sudden solitary human condition amplified beyond the silence of the environment."

She was purported to be a 101 year-old, half-Cherokee who survived the forced emigration, of the Cherokee in 1838, when the U.S. military forced some 15,000 Cherokees from their homes in Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee and moved them west to Indian Territory.

Now, for the first time, the real story of Granny Dollar has been told.

Her tale was also useful to for covering shameful details surrounding her family's history. Ultimately, her persona served to ensure her well-being and security when she could no longer work and in a place and time when a single woman had few alternatives."

9781716189432,"The first book banned by the Biden Administration - Just two days after its publication... Widely criticised by Wikipedia and progressive pundits, this book was at the same time hailed by the Wall Street Journal: ""They offer a long view of its meaning: America's history is objectively extraordinary, and we should accept that. It should be faithfully taught that way."" This well-written, non-partisan study describes the founding of this country and the lessons learned through its two centuries of growth. Released on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the report followed President Donald Trump's September announcement to form a commission to refute teachings on systemic racism, critical race theory, and deeper examinations of how slavery has affected American society. The ""crusade against American history is toxic propaganda, ideological poison, that, if not removed, will dissolve the civic bonds that tie us together, will destroy our country,"" Trump said at the time. This is an outstanding guide to start teaching fair and honest approaches to history for any home-schooling family or independent school. Also included in this anthology are the Declaration of Independence, the US Constitution, and the Articles of Confederation. This gives you a well-rounded and accurate view of our American culture through the factual historical documents of its founding. Anthology containing: - The 1776 Report - Declaration of Independence - The US Consitition - Articles of Confederation"
