9780831136550,"Vectors are perhaps the most important mathematical objects used in modeling and animation. They have the properties of magnitude and direction, and provide visual understanding of model construction and analysis. Matrices are natural and hardworking partners of vectors. This work presents lessons on vectors and matrices in geometric and 3D modeling--the mathematics at the foundation of computer graphics applications. The lessons appear as chapters, generally organized from introductory to more complex topics. Within each chapter, there is a similar order of elementary-to-advanced discussion.  Here are topics that are usually published in briefer form in more advanced texts as part of their supporting mathematics. In this work, vectors and matrices are the main subjects. This text offers an easier-to-understand introduction to the main ideas behind vectors and matrices, stripped of formalism, and leading directly to geometric modeling. It demonstrates the relationships between vectors, matrices, basis vectors and barycentric coordinates, all of which are not usually seen in ordinary texts. This text also discusses how these concepts are applied to produce curves and surfaces, and how they facilitate the analysis of spatial relationships.  For those readers beginning studies in geometric and 3D modeling, animation, CGI, or CAD/CAM, this work serves as an introduction to vectors and matrices, and provides a good start to understanding how they are applied. For instructors, this book can be a primary text or supplement to more advanced or specialized texts on geometric and 3D modeling. FeaturesMore than 150 illustrations support visual understanding of the content.100+ exercises and extended solutions enhance the classroom environment.A comprehensive range of topics offers an in-depth look at the math underlying 3D modeling and animation courses.Linear algebra and calculus are not prerequisites."

If you can use a ruler, you can use OpenSCAD This book is for Makers, Engineers, and anyone who wants to create 3D shapes for 3D printing or manufacturing.OpenSCAD has some great advantages over other software you might choose to use. It's free, runs on Windows, Macs, and Linux machines, has a much shorter learning curve, and it puts you in control of your designs instead of your designs controlling you Using a fun, recipe-like pattern, this book guides you through simple 3D designs that cover 99% of the operations and techniques used day-to-day with OpenSCAD. You'll be baking and making in no time at all  Guidance is provided where you might need some of the more obscure features of the language, but the focus is on fast and efficient learning of the core basics.OpenSCAD works in a different way compared to the expensive commercial software packages typically used for 3D design. Instead of interactively choosing from a multitude of obscure, hard to remember icons, buttons, menus, and sub-feature options to sketch out your designs with a mouse, OpenSCAD lets you edit a text-based script that creates your 3D objects. You get the best of both worlds, because you can easily pan, rotate, and zoom to see your creations in space, but the creation of those shapes is much more in your control and understanding.Contents: Getting StartedWhy Use OpenSCADInstall OpenSCAD CheatsheetHow to Learn from this BookRecipe 1: Hello World Meatball  Recipe 2: Create a Square Sheetcake Recipe 3: Parameterization Recipe 4: Create a Circle Recipe 5: Rotation and Translation Recipe 6: Create a Polygon Recipe 7: Trimming the Edges Recipe 8: Stamp Your Name On It Recipe 9: Extruding Into Space Recipe 10: Create a Donut Recipe 11: Kitchen Tips and Tricks Recipe 12: Functions, Modules, and Regular Polygons Recipe 13: No Matter How You Slice It Recipe 14: Create the ""Holey"" Grail Recipe 15: Birthday Candles & Other Common Cylinders Recipe 16: Ice Cubes for Party Drinks Recipe 17: Polyhedron Souffle Recipe 18: After-Dinner Mints and ToothpicksRecipe 19: Use a Recipe Box Recipe 20: Mirror Mirror on the Plane Recipe 21: Popcorn and Other Hulls Recipe 22: Minkowski Mints Appendix A Using OpenSCADMenusIcons and ButtonsMouse UseCreating STLFilesAnimationIndex About John Clark CraigREVIEWS: As an OpenSCAD tutorial, this book is amazing.
