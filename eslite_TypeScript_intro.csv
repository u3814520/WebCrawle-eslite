The protagonists, Alba and Dídac, retreat to the forest, then journey to the rubble of Barcelona to rescue and preserve the remnants of human civilization in the city's bombed libraries and cultural institutions. In the absence of the rule of law and social norms, the children create a utopian world of two that honors knowledge and interracial love, to become a new Adam and Eve and try to bring about the world's second origin. A bestseller and required reading for secondary school students in Catalonia, Typescript of the Second Origin is indispensable to understand how a region of Spain whose language, culture, and institutions were targeted and punished by Francisco Franco.

本書內容改編自第 11 屆 iT邦幫忙鐵人賽， Modern Web 組冠軍網路系列文章──《讓 TypeScript 成為你全端開發的 ACE！》── 除了是單純入門 TypeScript 語言的技術書籍外，也是第一本屬於台灣本土的 TypeScript 專書；由微軟（Microsoft）研發出的 TypeScript，為近年來逐漸熱門的技術，是軟體社群上擁有眾多廠商與開發者青睞的前、後端開發工具，本書旨在介紹 TypeScript 這門語言的使用方法與技巧。 


四大重點 

➣ 漸進式型別系統：原始、物件、泛用與常用進階型別等。 
本書一大重點在於型別系統的重要性以及使用方式；除此之外，可以從型別系統來認識一門語言的特性、運作過程、效果與細節，對於程式語言本身的設計會有更深層的理解。 
➣ TypeScript 高效技巧：除錯、規格查詢、結合 JavaScript 專案的方法。 
好的 TypeScript 程式碼除了可以提升開發效率外，除錯（Debug）的痛苦程度會大大的降低；並且也會介紹原生 JavaScript 專案是如何不需全部重寫成 TypeScript 就可以結合 TypeScript 專案的秘密。 
➣ 標準物件導向程式設計入門：類別、介面、 SOLID 原則。 
TypeScript 對於物件導向程式設計方面的語法支援完備度較現階段的 JavaScript 以及 ECMAScript 標準高，因此讀者可以藉由 TypeScript 學習到物件導向程式設計的觀念。 
➣ TypeScript & ECMAScript：語法糖的使用、非同步程式設計。 
本書不僅會討論到 JavaScript、ECMAScript 以及 TypeScript 之間的關係，並且也會介紹在 TypeScript 使用 ECMAScript 標準語法時需要注意的事項。"
