Many employees would like to continue to work remotely, while some would like to go back to the office. Leaders face a monumental decision - do we go back to the office or continue to work-from-anywhere? Should we do a mixture of both?The Anywhere Operating System is your user manual for navigating this workplace transformation that will change the way we live and work.""This guide escapes the canopy of theoretical and delivers actionable intel to create and evolve a remote-first work environment."" - Darren Murph, Head of Remote @ Gitlab""Remote work equips workers with the autonomy and flexibility to do their best work regardless of where they're located. However, building a remote team takes intention and can be difficult to get right.

9.78174E+12,"Transform Your Life and LeadershipThere are two ways to get through the great rainforest in Brazil: You can hack your way through the dense forest with a machete... ...or you can find the nearest tributary that will eventually take you through the jungle to the mighty Amazon river. The Human Operating System is like the Amazon in that it flows through the heart of leadership development like a mighty river.Applying the five transformative principles of the Human Operating System is so much more effective than hacking through the forest of leadership trade books, workshops, and management techniques. Many of these tools can be helpful, but they often function more like apps or accessories rather than a deeper operating system that can offer meaning, direction, and coherence to everything you might do as a leader. Jack Nicholson and Rob Murray have been developing the Human Operating System over many years of work with executive leaders, teams, and organizations. The deep change process and principles embedded in the Human Operating System have made a significant difference with leaders who have become frustrated, depleted, and fragmented, trying to build enterprises with tools and resources no longer sufficient. With the Human Operating System, leaders can experience a sense of flow and convergence that makes leading their organization much more energizing and fulfilling than merely trying harder and running faster to perform. When the Human Operating System is installed, everything else in leader and organizational development can work better. That is the hope of this book: that high-capacity leaders and teams will experience the authentic power, energy, and strength of the Amazon River flowing beneath them. Change your life as a leader forever. Get this book now."

If yes, then keep reading...Linux has been well-known as one of the most powerful operating systems in the world of cybersecurity and coding.Among its various components, Kali Linux is one of the distributions which can be treated like a boon for ethical hackers and IT people. However, everything comes with several problems. In this world of today, people have excessive trust in Kali Linux capabilities by default only. As a result, most users are not paying attention to the various manual aspects of Linux security. It is true that with Linux, you can automate many of your tasks. However, it also requires some manual touch for keeping everything with the pace. This fact even becomes more evident when it comes to the concept of security. Though an operating system might automate all your tasks, it is your task to be anxious always. You are required to keep a close eye on the settings of our application and various other details. When you have a well-configured Kali Linux system, it might turn out to be the most difficult thing to crack. However, most Kali Linux users do not have profound knowledge about what is required for keeping their whole systems locked up. If you start using a brand-new application, try to pay very close attention to its configuration details. Running the application with the same example settings and then using it is not the ideal option. It is not at all recommended. Some of the developers in the past also put decoy settings in the applications to make sure that the applications are prevented from running. This was a great way to ensure that all the users have checked out the file of a configuration of the application. When it comes to permissions, it forms an essential part of Linux. It is essential for a user to clearly understand how every permission functions and the implications of the various components of the OS. If you are shifting from Windows to Linux, the generalized concept might be a bit different and awkward for you. The general rule of Kali Linux is that you are not supposed to use root for your daily work. This might sound like a bit of a surprise for all the Windows users in which the operating system handles the various permissions, which are critical in nature in a different way. It is surely an inconvenient function to type a password each time you want the machine to execute a function. However, it is practical and will surely help prevent some serious security problems with your machine in the future.

If yes, then keep reading...In layman's terms, hacking is the act of breaking into someone else's computer to which you have no access and stealing private information by circumventing the security measures. It is dangerous because it sabotages the entire computer system.The origin of the word ""hacking"" can be traced back to the 1960's and 1970's. Some hackers, called Yippe, were anti-war protestors and members of the Youth International Party. They played pranks in the streets, and most of their prank techniques were taught within their group. It is important to note that they were involved in tapping telephone lines as well. Gradually, what was called a prank grew to another level and became known as hacking. However, this time their tools were state-of-the-art mega core processors and multi-function plasma screens.Hacking tactics are increasingly being used by terrorist organizations for numerous acts of evil, including obtaining illegal funding, spreading propaganda, launching missiles, threatening the government and gathering intelligence about secret military movements.In this book, various types of hacking will be broken down and explained. Step by step instructions will be provided so that you can protect yourself from hackers in your office and home, as well as on the internet.

9.78053E+12,"Serial entrepreneurs David Kidder and Christina Wallace reveal their revolutionary playbook for igniting growth inside established companies. Most established companies face a key survival challenge, says David Kidder, CEO of Bionic, lifelong entrepreneur, and angel investor in more than thirty startups: operational efficiency and outdated bureaucracy are at war with new growth. Legacy companies are skilled at growing big businesses into even bigger ones. But they are less adept at discovering new opportunities and turning them into big businesses, the way entrepreneurs and early-stage investors must. In New to Big, Kidder and Wallace reveal their proprietary blueprint for installing a permanent growth capability inside any company--the Growth Operating System. The Growth OS borrows the best tools, systems, and mind-sets from entrepreneurship and venture capital and adapts them for established organizations, leveraging these two distinct skills as a form of management for building in a future that is uncertain. By focusing on what consumers do rather than what they say, celebrating productive failure, embracing a portfolio approach, and learning from the outside-in, Kidder and Wallace argue any company can go on offense and win the future. This isn't about a one-off innovation moonshot. It's about building a permanent ladder to the moon."

9.78168E+12,"Linux is a powerful open-source operating system that has been around for many years and is widely used for running servers and websites. But most students and Makers encounter it for the first time when they are working on projects with their Raspberry Pi or similar single-board computers (SBCs) such as BeagleBone Black or Intel Galileo. Linux for Makers is the first book that explains the Linux operating system specifically for Makers, as opposed to programmers and administrators. By gaining a deeper understanding of Linux, Makers can add another useful tool to their kit that will help them build their projects more easily.Written with the Maker in mind, this book will focus mostly on Rasbian running on the Raspberry Pi as it is the most prolific in the ecosystem today. However most of the topics covered will apply broadly to other Linux distributions and will be called out when they may differ. Many times users cut and paste from a website tutorial into the Linux command line without understanding what they are actually doing only to be frustrated when they want to modify or tweak something to suit their needs. Also, many Makers shy away from using the Raspberry Pi or similar board because they feel Linux is too foreign and they think using a command line will be more difficult than using a GUI. This book aims to overcome those fears and provide a foundation for further learning and exploration. To that end, this book will focus on the basic principles that a Maker would need to know as opposed to other resources that go into detail that is not particularly relevant to building projects."

Rather than awkwardly superimpose a new language over the top of the pre-existing non-Thai sound and meaning system of your mother tongue, Cracking Thai Fundamentals will teach you to think about language, culture and meanings, produce meanings, speak, read and react in Thai in a way that much more resembles the way Thais think about and produce their language themselves."
9.78026E+12,"How social networks, the personalized Internet, and always-on mobile connectivity are transforming--and expanding--social life.Daily life is connected life, its rhythms driven by endless email pings and responses, the chimes and beeps of continually arriving text messages, tweets and retweets, Facebook updates, pictures and videos to post and discuss. Our perpetual connectedness gives us endless opportunities to be part of the give-and-take of networking.Some worry that this new environment makes us isolated and lonely. But in Networked, Lee Rainie and Barry Wellman show how the large, loosely knit social circles of networked individuals expand opportunities for learning, problem solving, decision making, and personal interaction. The new social operating system of ""networked individualism"" liberates us from the restrictions of tightly knit groups; it also requires us to develop networking skills and strategies, work on maintaining ties, and balance multiple overlapping networks.Rainie and Wellman outline the ""triple revolution"" that has brought on this transformation: the rise of social networking, the capacity of the Internet to empower individuals, and the always-on connectivity of mobile devices. Drawing on extensive evidence, they examine how the move to networked individualism has expanded personal relationships beyond households and neighborhoods; transformed work into less hierarchical, more team-driven enterprises; encouraged individuals to create and share content; and changed the way people obtain information. Rainie and Wellman guide us through the challenges and opportunities of living in the evolving world of networked individuals."

,"Her is a science-fiction romance film directed by Spike Jonze. In the not so distant future, Theodore, a lonely writer, purchases a newly developed operating system designed to meet the user’s every need. To Theodore’s surprise, a romantic relationship blossoms between him and the software. Technology and love blend in an unexpected tale that explores the nature of emotion, and the ways that tech isolate - and connect - us all. Her was a striking success, and was nominated for five five Oscars including Best Picture. The original score to Her was composed by the band Arcade Fire with additional music provided by Owen Pallett. Their music is a constant companion to Theodore, and runs as a delicate, airy thread through the film. Though critically lauded and nominated for Best Original Score, Her has been unreleased until now. Her (Original Score) features 13 tracks from Arcade Fire and Owen Pallet mastered specifically for the vinyl format, including the delightful ""Supersymmetry"". This release is pressed on a white vinyl record and housed in an inner sleeve within a single pocket jacket.【走進閱讀世界｜迷誠品:專文推薦】標題｜唱片行裡職人的黑膠推薦，１０張專輯「樂」聽「樂」對味！（播放清單隨時更新）撰文｜誠品音樂・編輯｜Millie 米粒誠品音樂館成立於1999年，至今引進超過20萬種影音出版品，廣納豐富多元兼具深度音樂推薦，也積極邀請音樂人現場演出，不斷延伸人文生活向度。數位時代，黑膠唱片是一個什麼樣的存在？如果你走進唱片行，你會發現這裡的音樂，讓忙亂的生活步調慢了下來，每張作品依原本的順序播放著......誠品音樂職人皆在音樂領域深耕多年，擁有獨到的見解與品味，如果你也正在尋找音樂的路上，職人的黑膠選品可能會是你的方向。☞點此進入迷誠品閱讀文章"
9.78067E+12,"A scholar and activist tells the story of change makers operating within the Chinese Communist system, whose ideas of social action necessarily differ from those dominant in Western, liberal societies. The Chinese government has increased digital censorship under Xi Jinping. Why? Because online activism works; it is perceived as a threat in halls of power. In The Other Digital China, Jing Wang, a scholar at MIT and an activist in China, shatters the view that citizens of nonliberal societies are either brainwashed or complicit, either imprisoned for speaking out or paralyzed by fear. Instead, Wang shows the impact of a less confrontational kind of activism. Whereas Westerners tend to equate action with open criticism and street revolutions, Chinese activists are building an invisible and quiet coalition to bring incremental progress to their society. Many Chinese change makers practice nonconfrontational activism. They prefer to walk around obstacles rather than break through them, tactfully navigating between what is lawful and what is illegitimate. The Other Digital China describes this massive gray zone where NGOs, digital entrepreneurs, university students, IT companies like Tencent and Sina, and tech communities operate. They study the policy winds in Beijing, devising ways to press their case without antagonizing a regime where taboo terms fluctuate at different moments. What emerges is an ever-expanding networked activism on a grand scale. Under extreme ideological constraints, the majority of Chinese activists opt for neither revolution nor inertia. They share a mentality common in China: rules are meant to be bent, if not resisted."
