9781914054136,"With Kubernetes, it is possible and easy for you to automate the deployment, management, and scaling of any containerized applications. You can use this container to group containers which make up a particular application into a number of logical units to make it easy for discovery and management. This container operates by use of the same technique which makes Google run many containers numbering in the billions on a weekly basis, and it can scale and you will not be required to increase the ops team. Kubernetes is a very flexible container, whether you are running it locally or on a global enterprise, and it will allow you to be able to deliver your container in an easier and more consistent manner despite how complex it might be. It is open source, and you are able to move your workloads to where you need. A large number of major companies appreciate the potential to save on costs when it comes to containers and Kubernetes. In particular, containers are more lightweight than VMs and can share a single OS, which causes a significant decrease in the costs of infrastructure. Their maintenance costs are also low. Additionally, they have faster CI/CD pipelines and allow your development and engineering teams better coordination with each other. Adding Kubernetes to the equation more benefits are gained. By autoscaling you can save more. The other benefits include efficient application scheduling, efficient cluster-level resource management, and rolling updates. - How Kubernetes operates- Deployment- Kubernetes pods- Kubernetes services- Kubernetes design patterns- Kubernetes cliene libraries and extensions- Logging- The intricacies of this management plane in Kubernetes- Cluster federation- Kubernetes ingress...And much moreOverall, you can expect to save your team's time and also make a two-digit saving all thanks to both containerized applications and container orchestration. Applications are deployed through containers focusing on operating-system-level virtualization as opposed to hardware virtualization. This enables us to put an end to the limitations of the host by selecting executable file-systems, libraries, and etc. With Kubernetes, connecting applications with appropriate services through configuring firewalls of the cloud service providers can be made at once. In complex configurations, it creates an external load-balancer and discovering cross-cluster service through the use of federated services."

9781492048046,"Operators are a way of packaging, deploying, and managing Kubernetes applications. A Kubernetes application doesn't just run on Kubernetes; it's composed and managed in Kubernetes terms. Operators add application-specific operational knowledge to a Kubernetes cluster, making it easier to automate complex, stateful applications and to augment the platform. Operators can coordinate application upgrades seamlessly, react to failures automatically, and streamline repetitive maintenance like backups.Think of Operators as site reliability engineers in software. They work by extending the Kubernetes control plane and API, helping systems integrators, cluster administrators, and application developers reliably deploy and manage key services and components. Using real-world examples, authors Jason Dobies and Joshua Wood demonstrate how to use Operators today and how to create Operators for your applications with the Operator Framework and SDK.Learn how to establish a Kubernetes cluster and deploy an OperatorExamine a range of Operators from usage to implementationExplore the three pillars of the Operator Framework: the Operator SDK, the Operator Lifecycle Manager, and Operator MeteringBuild Operators from the ground up using the Operator SDKBuild, package, and run an Operator in development, testing, and production phasesLearn how to distribute your Operator for installation on Kubernetes clusters"

9789865501167,"伴隨著容器相關技術的興起，Prometheus 正逐步成為容器監控的標準，並且對於傳統應用和裝置也有很好的相容性。 全書共分為4 篇12 章，分別說明Prometheus 原理、在傳統應用監控和Kubernetes 監控中的應用，以及原始程式和擴充。 Prometheus 由Go 語言撰寫而成，採用Pull 方式取得監控資訊，並提供了多維度的資料模型和靈活的查詢介面。Prometheus 不僅可以透過靜態檔案設定監控物件，還支援自動發現機制，能夠透過Kubernetes、Consul、DNS 等多種方式動態取得監控物件。在資料獲取方面，借助Go 語言的高平行處理特性，單機Prometheus 可以擷取數百個節點的監控資料；在資料儲存方面，隨著本機時序資料庫的不斷最佳化，單機Prometheus 每秒可以擷取一千萬個指標，如果需要儲存大量的歷史監控資料，則還支援遠端儲存。 全書重點涵蓋： ►最強大的系控監控平台，可監控叢集、伺服器、虛擬、容器 ►完整的資源管理、包括網路、儲存、CPU、記憶體、作業系統 ►不需要自行組合Logstash/ElasticSearch/Kibana，單一完整監控系統 ►最重要的就是針對Kubernetes的完整監控 ►包括Kubernetes容器、服務自動發現等 ►針對Kubernetes的物件、如cAdvisor, apiserver, kube-state-metrics ►Kubernetes叢集監控，Granfna的使用 ►完整Prometheus的原始碼分析及改裝 本書特色 ◎ 系統講解Prometheus的原理、應用、原始程式和擴充 ◎ 圖文並茂、由淺入深、完整解說 適合讀者群：運維工程師、軟體架構師、研發工程師，及相關IT產業工作者參考和閱讀。"
9789869772662,網際網路架構不斷演化，經歷從集中式架構到分散式架構，再到雲端原生架構的過程。雲端原生因能解決傳統應用升級緩慢、架構臃腫、不能快速反覆運算等問題，而成為未來雲端應用的目標。 本書首先介紹架構演化過程及雲端原生的概念，讓讀者對基礎概念能有一個準確的瞭解。接著闡述分散式、服務化、Observability、容器調度、Service Mesh、雲資料庫等體系及其原理，並介紹與其相關的Dubbo、Spring Cloud、SkyWalking、Kubernetes、Istio開源解決方案。最後深度揭秘開源分散式資料庫生態圈Sharding-Sphere的設計與實現。 適合讀者群：具有前端工作經驗的工程師或架構師，或對雲端原生有興趣 者。
